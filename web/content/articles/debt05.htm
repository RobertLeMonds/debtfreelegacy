                          <span class="bold">by Michael &amp; Kathy McDonald</span></p>
                        <p>The Bible has over two thousand scriptures about finances 
                          and stewardship that teach us about how to use money 
                          wisely. What we are learning is that it&#8217;s important 
                          to be out of debt &#8211; not to be able to buy more 
                          stuff &#8211; but to be able to give more and bless 
                          people that need help. Can you see God smiling as we 
                          acknowledge that all financial decisions are really 
                          spiritual decisions?</p>
                        <p>We&#8217;re supposed to figure out what pleases Christ 
                          and then do it. Noah pleased God and because he did 
                          we are alive today. From his life we can learn five 
                          acts of worship that make God smile.</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Noah loved God more than anything else in the world, 
                            even money. God deeply loves us and He desires our 
                            love in return. The only way to learn to know Him 
                            is to spend time with Him.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
                          <li> Noah trusted God. He built a ship in the middle 
                            of dry land. Noah had never seen rain because God 
                            irrigated from the ground up; he lived far from the 
                            ocean; and then there was the problem of rounding 
                            up all the animals. Noah totally trusted God. We all 
                            have areas in which we need to trust God. The two 
                            of us are learning to totally trust God in finances.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                          <li> God smiles when we obey him and He loves good stewardship. 
                            Noah did everything exactly as God had commanded him. 
                            He did not question God. I&#8217;ve asked God a few 
                            questions &#8211; Are you sure you want me to be debt 
                            free? Are you sure you want us to have our finances 
                            together? It&#8217;s so much easier the other way 
                            with, &#8220;easy credit&#8221;.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                          <li> Noah praised God and had a heart of thanksgiving. 
                            Noah built an altar to God and sacrificed burnt offerings 
                            on it. We praise God for who He is and thank Him for 
                            what He has done. When we enjoy what God has done 
                            for us and express that enjoyment, it brings Him joy.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                          <li> God is pleased when we use our abilities wisely 
                            and steward the resources He give us. After the flood, 
                            God gave Noah simple instructions &#8211; be fruitful 
                            and increase in number and fill the earth. It was 
                            time to get on with life. God enjoys watching every 
                            detail of our lives. Just as we enjoy watching our 
                            children, God enjoys watching us. And our children 
                            do not have to be perfect or mature for us to enjoy 
                            them and neither do we with God. Psalm 147:11 (Amplified) 
                            &#8220;The Lord takes pleasure in those who reverently 
                            and worshipfully fear Him, in those who hope in His 
                            mercy and loving-kindness.&#8221;</li>
