                        <p>If you are old enough to remember the Cold War, you 
                          may recall the contrast between the news of the free 
                          world and the propaganda of the communists. The real 
                          purpose of propaganda is to control the thinking of 
                          the reader, so that he does whatever those who created 
                          the propaganda want him to do.</p>
                        <p>The Cold War is over, and the truth of freedom defeated 
                          the lies of communism. Yet Americans are subjected to 
                          a flood of deceptive propaganda that is just as harmful 
                          as the worst of the Cold War. We call it &#8220;advertising&#8221;. 
                          Those who create advertising often do not care whether 
                          the ads are informative, nor do they care whether it 
                          is in your best interest to buy their product; they 
                          care only about getting people to buy something they 
                          otherwise would not and perhaps should not purchase. 
                          Their goal is to manipulate you.</p>
                        <p>For example, I saw an advertisement for a &#8220;SmartBuy&#8221; 
                          on a popular SUV. In very large type, it promoted a 
                          surprisingly low monthly payment for such an expensive 
                          vehicle. The purpose of this advertisement is to deceive 
                          a person who cannot afford this high dollar vehicle 
                          into thinking he can. Three years later, when the agreement 
                          expires, he will suddenly discover that he never could 
                          afford it. The terms require that he pay a huge balloon 
                          payment, or turn-in the vehicle and pay a fee for each 
                          mile over 10,000 per year, and pay for every little 
                          scratch and ding. Of course there will be lots of them&#8212;why 
                          would anyone get a rugged SUV just to drive it only 
                          on paved streets?</p>
                        <p>Look at cosmetics advertisements: they show retouched 
                          photos of unreal people with unrealistic poses wearing 
                          unwearable clothes to get you to believe that, if you 
                          buy their product, you will somehow look like the model, 
                          or at least feel like you do. They are depending on 
                          you to help them with their deception by deceiving yourself. 
                          Many people willingly cooperate.</p>
                        <p>Our award for the most deceptive advertisement goes 
                          to one that shows a sexy young woman wearing a skimpy 
                          negligee with bold copy that says, &#8220;Time to get 
                          back into the game.&#8221; This is followed by the name 
                          of a divorce lawyer. I could spend hours counting the 
                          deceptions in that one.</p>
                        <p>The most subtle deceptive ads are the ones that deceive 
                          you into thinking that you need something that you really 
                          only want. The Federal Government cannot protect you 
                          from this kind of deception because God never intended 
                          them to. They can eliminate ads that are proven to contain 
                          false promises, but the very best liars know how to 
                          manipulate and/or deceive without the deception being 
                          detected. Please do not think that this is a slam against 
                          the advertising industry&#8212;it is not. They themselves 
                          are deceived into believing that their purpose is to 
                          maximize sales rather than to serve (be a blessing to) 
                          both sellers and buyers.</p>
                        <p>Jesus said, &#8220;You will know the truth and the 
                          truth will set you free.&#8221; (John 8:32, NIV). To 
                          know the truth means to hear and accept a truthful message, 
                          which requires a truthful messenger. Jesus promised 
                          that God would &#8220;give you another Counselor to 
                          be with you forever&#8212;the Spirit of truth.&#8221; 
                          (John 14:16). He does not plaster his message on billboards, 
                          nor does he interrupt your TV programs to force you 
                          to listen. But He will speak if you ask Him to. Each 
                          time you think of buying something, the Holy Spirit 
                          can tell you whether this is something God wants you 
                          to have. God does not just provide for your needs; he 
                          also gives you some of your &#8220;wants&#8221;, but 
                          normally not all of them. If you are not sure, just 
                          ask Him. After some practice, you will learn to hear 
                          God&#8217;s voice when you consider a purchase, because 
                          God wants you to. When you know the truth, it is easy 
                          to spot the lies. In fact, they become ridiculous, because 
                          they no longer have any power over you.</p>
                        <p>It is ironic that advertisers spend years in school 
                          and many more years on the job to learn the subtle art 
                          of manipulating buyers; yet you can learn to overcome 
                          their art in a very short time, using a simple communication 
                          method that most of these professional communicators 
                          will never understand. God uses the simple things to 
                          confound the &#8220;wise&#8221;. His Word, the Bible, 
                          provides over 2,000 scriptures that relate to wise use 
                          of His resources. Let&#8217;s tune-out the manipulative 
                          ads and tune into God&#8217;s success manual.</p>
