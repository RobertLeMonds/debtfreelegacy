                          <span class="bold">by Tracy Young</span></p>
                        <p>Late one evening, I arrived home and went to retire 
                          for the night in my bedroom. Gunshots rang out in rapid 
                          succession, followed by the sounds of squealing tires. 
                          I then did something very foolish. I turned on the lights 
                          and ran outside. </p>
                        <p>People started coming out of various doors to meet 
                          those who were already outside. They asked each other 
                          if they were okay. We figured out that my neighbor was 
                          the target and were relieved to know that she was alive. 
                          She was hyperventilating but all right. Confusion and 
                          fear overcame the neighborhood. The only limited information 
                          we had, at that moment, was that a white truck had terrorized 
                          our little block. At that moment, another innocent white 
                          truck started coming down the street. Neighbors started 
                          dropping flat to the ground while others ran behind 
                          trees or cars. We did not know who our enemies were. 
                          Soon, the neighborhood was filled with sirens, police 
                          cars and paramedics. Index cards in the street marked 
                          the bullet casings. Men in suits arrived and took statements. 
                          Holes in a jagged line remained in my sweet neighbor's 
                          house. </p>
                        <p>Later, I talked to my neighbor on the other side about 
                          the incident. Her husband is a police officer who was 
                          away on duty at the time. She heard the shots and immediately 
                          turned out all the lights and hit the ground. I realized 
                          how foolish I was. Her husband would have grabbed his 
                          weapon and acted in a trained precise manner. She said 
                          that you have to have a weapon, knowledge and training; 
                          otherwise you are just acting foolishly. </p>
                        <p>Spiritual Warfare is going on and you are part of that 
                          war whether you choose to be or not. John 10:10 tells 
                          us that the enemy comes to steal, kill and destroy. 
                          He will leave behind terror, fear and confusion. You 
                          can fight the enemy, but you better have your weapon, 
                          knowledge and training. God&#8217;s Word tells us: &quot;I 
                          have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions 
                          and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing 
                          will harm you.&quot; (Luke 10:19 NIV) </p>
                        <p>God has given the body of Christ the authority to withstand 
                          the enemy. We have the authority to use the name of 
                          Jesus and the enemy will flee. We can bind the enemy's 
                          plots and desires. &quot;And I will give you the keys 
                          of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth 
                          will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth 
                          will be loosed in heaven.&quot; (Matthew 16:19 NKJV) 
                        </p>
                        <p>Train yourself in the knowledge of the Word of God. 
                          Memorize the verses where attacks come from the most. 
                          When you see the enemy coming down your street and whenever 
                          he starts to attack your finances, your health, or your 
                          life, you stand on the Word of God and hit the devil 
                          hard with spiritual warfare &#8211; it works! </p>
                        <p>Realize that all evil spirits are subject to your authority 
                          in Christ Jesus. There is nothing that the enemy can 
                          do to harm you in any way. You have all spiritual strength, 
                          mental strength, and physical strength over the enemy. 
                          You command the spirit of disease to leave you alone 
                          and you command the spirit of poverty to leave you. 
                          Whatever goes against the Word of God is not to be allowed 
                          in your life. You are a child of God, bought and paid 
                          for at a price. Jesus paid that price for you and God 
                          has given you the authority to use the name of Jesus. 
                          Gain that knowledge, practice and train with that knowledge 
                          and then act upon it. </p>
                        <p>Do so, and you will not be someone running outside 
                          to face the enemy with just his bare hands, but you 
                          will be a mighty warrior facing the enemy with a large 
                          tank and the barrel aimed at his head.</p>
