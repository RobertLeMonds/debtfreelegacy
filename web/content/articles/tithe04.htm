                        <p>(Malachi 3:8-12 AMP)</p>
                        <p>God speaks, &quot;Will a man rob or defraud God? Yet 
                          you rob and defraud Me.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Man looks perplexed and asks, &quot;In what way do 
                          we rob or defraud You?&quot;</p>
                        <p>God answers, &quot;You have withheld your tithes and 
                          offerings. You are cursed with the curse, for you are 
                          robbing Me, even this whole nation.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Man ponders how to reverse the curse.</p>
                        <p>God looks at Man and says, &quot;Bring ALL the tithes 
                          (the whole tenth of your<br>
                          income) into the storehouse, that there may be food 
                          in My house, and prove Me now by it, says the Lord of 
                          hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for 
                          you and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not 
                          be room enough to receive it.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Man looks at God with a startled expression. God has 
                          never asked anyone to test Him before. This was a serious 
                          challenge.</p>
                        <p>God continued, &quot;And I will rebuke the devourer 
                          for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of 
                          your ground, neither shall your vine drop its fruit 
                          before the time in the field, says the Lord of hosts.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Man starts thinking to himself, that having the devourer 
                          rebuked FOR him is so much better than a curse. It was 
                          exciting that he would be able to keep the existing 
                          fruit and to be blessed in all future work.</p>
                        <p>God was not done, yet. God continued, &quot;And all 
                          nations shall call you happy and blessed, for you shall 
                          be a land of delight, says the Lord of hosts.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Man thinks about what was said. &quot;So on one hand, 
                          if I don't tithe and give back to Your house, I am cursed 
                          with a curse. Okay. On the other hand, if I give back 
                          to You a portion of what is ALREADY Yours, I will have 
                          the windows of heaven opened with blessings poured upon 
                          me. In addition, I will not have room enough to receive 
                          it? Why would I have too much of blessings and no where 
                          to put it?&quot; Before God could answer, Man figured 
                          it out. &quot;So that I would bless OTHERS with it! 
                          I would have the devourer rebuked for me, have all of 
                          my fruit secured, and the world would call me happy 
                          and blessed!&quot;</p>
                        <p>God said, &quot;I challenge you. Test me on this.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Man replied, &quot;Do I take the curses or the blessings? 
                          This is so lop-sided, there is only one choice. I will 
                          take the blessings and challenge you, Lord of Hosts!&quot;</p>
                        <p>The Lord of Hosts simply said, &quot;You shall then 
                          be a land of delight.&quot;</p>
                        <p>====</p>
                        <p> &#8220;Will a man rob God? <br>
                          Yet you have robbed Me! <br>
                          But you say, </p>
                        <p> &#8216; In what way have we robbed You?&#8217; <br>
                          In tithes and offerings. <br>
                          You are cursed with a curse, <br>
                          For you have robbed Me, <br>
                          Even this whole nation. <br>
                          Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, <br>
                          That there may be food in My house, <br>
                          And try Me now in this,&#8221; <br>
                          Says the LORD of hosts, </p>
                        <p> &#8220; If I will not open for you the windows of 
                          heaven <br>
                          And pour out for you such blessing <br>
                          That there will not be room enough to receive it.<br>
                          &#8220; And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, 
                          <br>
                          So that he will not destroy the fruit of your ground, 
                          <br>
                          Nor shall the vine fail to bear fruit for you in the 
                          field,&#8221; <br>
                          Says the LORD of hosts; <br>
                          And all nations will call you blessed, <br>
                          For you will be a delightful land,&#8221; <br>
                          Says the LORD of hosts.&quot; Malachi 3:8-12 NKJV</p>
