                        <p>When I was growing up, and as far back as I can remember, 
                          all I ever wanted to do with my life was be a homemaker 
                          who was at home raising my children and serving my family. 
                          After I was married and we had our first child, I thought 
                          that this would be the time for me to live my dream. 
                          I had truly purposed in my heart to get out of the Air 
                          Force and join in the defense of my Country by applying 
                          for and joining Civil Service, with the ultimate goal 
                          of staying home after the baby was born. </p>
                        <p>As we departed our overseas duty location, little did 
                          I realize that my husband did not share in my dream 
                          of being a homemaker. I became aware of the fact that 
                          he was not comfortable with my decision and my dream 
                          to stay home and raise our children was squashed! </p>
                        <p>This denial of my dream began a 19 year journey of 
                          unforgiveness. It eventually developed into a root of 
                          bitterness and after attending a 14-week Married for 
                          Life course, I recognized the damage my unmet dream 
                          had caused to our marriage. I purposed to forgive. But 
                          it wasn&#8217;t until several years later when we began 
                          the journey of teaching the Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks 
                          Plus Course, co-authored by Bill &amp; Maureen Sitter, 
                          did we come to realize just how much the unforgiveness 
                          was still rooted in our marriage and how it was affecting 
                          our finances. Sure, we were tithing, but we weren&#8217;t 
                          seeing the full promise of Malachi 3:8-12, (NKJ) which 
                          says: &#8220;Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me. But 
                          you ask, How do we rob you? In tithes and offerings. 
                          You are under a curse &#8211; the whole nation of you 
                          &#8211; because you are robbing me. Bring the whole 
                          tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in 
                          my house. Test me in this, says the Lord Almighty, and 
                          see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven 
                          and pour out so much blessing that you will not have 
                          room enough for it. I will prevent pests from devouring 
                          your crops, and the vines in your fields will not cast 
                          their fruit, says the Lord Almighty. Then all the nations 
                          will call you blessed, for yours will be a delightful 
                          land, says the Lord Almighty.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>Once I dealt with the unforgiveness and we aligned 
                          our financial picture to reflect the freewill giving 
                          of offerings (above the full 10% tithe) and the sowing 
                          of alms, for the poor did Malachi come alive in our 
                          finances. God has truly rebuked the devourer on our 
                          behalf and is pouring out a blessing. We&#8217;re giving 
                          more than we&#8217;ve ever given. We&#8217;re able to 
                          respond to the financial call for God&#8217;s Kingdom, 
                          and the more we cheerfully give, the more God blesses 
                          us! It started with unforgiveness, and it continues 
                          with forgiving and being faithful, good stewards with 
                          what God is entrusting to us for His Kingdom Glory!</p>
