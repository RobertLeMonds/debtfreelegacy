                          <span class="bold">by Glen Becker</span></p>
                        <p>The clearest scripture on greed is 1 Timothy 6:9-10 
                          (NIV): &#8220;People who want to get rich fall into 
                          temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful 
                          desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. For 
                          the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some 
                          people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith 
                          and pierced themselves with many griefs.&#8221; </p>
                        <p>Greed is the love of money. Many think that the Bible 
                          says, &#8220;Money is the root of all evil,&#8221; but 
                          it does not. The problem is not money, but the love 
                          of money. Love is a heart thing; Jesus said in Matthew 
                          6:33 (NIV) &#8220;seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, 
                          and all these things (food, clothing, etc.) will be 
                          given to you as well.&#8221; He goes on to say that 
                          you cannot serve both God and money.</p>
                        <p>God has no problem with wealth. Many of the heroes 
                          of the faith in scripture were wealthy men. There is 
                          nothing holy about being poor, nothing ungodly about 
                          being rich. The key is the heart. </p>
                        <p>Prosperity is having all you need to do what God called 
                          you to do. A prosperous man is content with what he 
                          has, a greedy man never is. God wants you to be prosperous.</p>
                        <p>I am a prosperous man. For example, we have three drivers 
                          in our household, and all three of us drive nice cars 
                          that are less than three years old, two purchased new 
                          and one was a top-of-the-line program car. I paid a 
                          total of $34,000 for all three of them. I know un-prosperous 
                          people who paid more than $34,000 for a single car, 
                          yet who are not satisfied with it. Greed never is. Prosperity 
                          is not having an expensive car; prosperity is having 
                          the right car.</p>
                        <p>Greed and prosperity have nothing to do with income 
                          or wealth. A person can be prosperous on a modest income; 
                          greedy people can be poor or be millionaires. Greed 
                          is a condition of the heart.</p>
                        <p>Johnny Carson, the former star of the Tonight Show, 
                          got a divorce many years ago. His ex-wife publicly commented 
                          on the proposed divorce settlement, &#8220;How can anyone 
                          expect me to live on only $20,000 per month?&#8221; 
                          Though she was offered a larger income than most of 
                          us will ever earn, and though she did not have to work 
                          for it, she was not a prosperous person. Greed was her 
                          master and she was its slave.</p>
                        <p>If you have spent time in the prison of greed, you 
                          can escape today. But do not think that Jesus will just 
                          open the prison door so you can just stroll out to wander 
                          around aimlessly. If you try, Greed will find you, grab 
                          you and throw you back in. Instead, ask Jesus to free 
                          you from the prison of Greed and lead you toward the 
                          Kingdom of Heaven. Ask him to provide you everything 
                          you need to do what he called you to do, and for the 
                          grace to be content with what you have. That is prosperity.</p>
