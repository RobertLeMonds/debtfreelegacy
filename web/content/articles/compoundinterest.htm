                          annually and the truth about compound interest</p>
                        <p><span class="articleTitle">Compound Interest </span><br>
                          <span class="bold">by Glen Becker</span></p>
                        <p>Compound Interest has been called &#8220;the Eighth 
                          Wonder of the World,&#8221; because it can cause a small 
                          amount of money to fairly rapidly grow into a very large 
                          amount of money.</p>
                        <p>Here is an example: suppose a person borrows $2000 
                          at 18% per year, and makes no payments. If interest 
                          is compounded annually, the debt will grow like this:</p>
                        <p><img src="images/compoundinterest.gif" width="500" height="205"></p>
                        <p>Of course you may consider this unrealistic. It is. 
                          No real credit card compounds annually; they all compound 
                          monthly. The same $2000 loan, compounded monthly at 
                          an 18% annual rate for 40 years, will grow to over $2.5 
                          million instead of the $1.5 million shown above. Getting 
                          realistic costs you an extra million in interest costs.</p>
                        <p>But you may think that this is unrealistic because 
                          no payments are made. But consider how many credit card 
                          users make only the minimum payment each month and charge 
                          that or more in new purchases. The net effect is that 
                          the payment only pays for the new purchases, and the 
                          old balance grows as if there were no payments. The 
                          only reason that your credit card balance cannot grow 
                          to $2.5 million is that the bank will hopefully never 
                          let your credit limit get that high. </p>
                        <p>Of course, you can get around that problem by taking 
                          out multiple credit cards. Many people do, and charge 
                          all of them to their limits, making only the minimum 
                          payment on each. The result is a monstrous debt that 
                          seems too large to ever repay. Because the debt is so 
                          large, their credit rating drops; they cannot take out 
                          new loans at low rates. Existing rates may escalate, 
                          especially if they get behind on their payments. We 
                          have seen examples of people of modest incomes owing 
                          $50,000 to $100,000 in credit card debt, at interest 
                          rates between 18% and 24%, who have tried to find lower 
                          rates and were unable to get them.</p>
                        <p>So, if interest is so important, why do we ignore it? 
                          Because it is &#8220;little&#8221;. We care only about 
                          the debt, we want to ignore the interest. The bank, 
                          however, cares a LOT about the interest, and they care 
                          that you don&#8217;t care.</p>
                        <p>What does God say about this? The basic idea is &#8220;growth 
                          creates more growth.&#8221; God depends on this for 
                          the Kingdom: Matt 13:31-32 is the parable of the mustard 
                          seed. There is not nearly enough energy in the seed 
                          to make a large plant. But there does not need to be. 
                          It uses &#8220;profits&#8221; from its leaves to make 
                          more leaves and grow to thousands of times its original 
                          size. If God wants His Kingdom to grow that way, does 
                          it not seem fitting for your finances to grow the same 
                          way?</p>
                        <p>How can you get this powerful force of compound interest 
                          to work for you instead of against you? Begin to aggressively 
                          pay off the highest rate credit card first. If you make 
                          an &#8220;investment&#8221; by paying extra principal 
                          on a debt that charges 18% to 24%, you get a guaranteed 
                          return of 18% to 24%. That&#8217;s the best possible 
                          return on any investment available today, and it is 
                          completely without risk. </p>
                        <p>To prove that this applies to you, take the debt that 
                          you owe with the highest interest rate and calculate 
                          the amount of interest you will have to pay if you continue 
                          to just make the minimum payments. The number will seem 
                          astronomical, but God wants to show you how to put debt 
                          bondage under your heel. Begin today.</p>
