<hr> <p class="boldRed">Practical  Advice for Potential Business Start-Ups and the Self Employed</p>
<p>For  almost 20 years we have provided training geared to help people achieve and  sustain genuine Financial Freedom, using God&rsquo;s principles coupled with  practical advice.&nbsp; Meanwhile I (Bill Sitter) was operating a small business and  employing these same concepts.&nbsp; During  this time my wife and I, and our volunteer small group leaders often  encountered potential entrepreneurs and self-employed people who lacked the basic  financial wisdom to succeed.&nbsp; There are scores  of books and courses devoted to business start-ups and even to offer self  employed guidelines.&nbsp; This short article  will attempt to outline a few foundational principles that may spell the  difference between a successful business venture, using Godly principles, and a  dismal failure.</p>
<p>First  steps must involve getting a very good handle on your personal and family  financial status.&nbsp; Sounds simple and  obvious but all too often we speak with ladies and gentlemen who are ready to  jump into a business opportunity without a firm grasp of their own  finances.&nbsp; This can be rectified by first  completing the exercises in Chapters 1 &ndash; 7 of the &ldquo;Legacy Edition of Financial  Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Doing so will  ensure that singles and couples have an understanding of God&rsquo;s principles for  money and business.&nbsp; Short and long term  goals are written down as part of this training, to clearly identify targets  and timelines, for all involved parties.</p>
In the process of completing this 7 week study (individually  or in a small group) you will learn how to prepare all the following financial  forms:&nbsp; Income and Biblical Giving, Debt  Repayment Schedule, List of Assets,  List of Liabilities, Personal Balance Sheet &amp; Net Worth Statement,  Estimated Monthly Living Expenses, and a Cash Flow Control system.
<p>&ldquo;Guidelines  for the Self-Employed&rdquo; are provided in Chapter 2.&nbsp; Over the years we&rsquo;ve been shocked at the  number of business owners who lack an understanding of gross revenue (gross  business receipts) and real &ldquo;increase&rdquo;.&nbsp;  These few pages in the workbook are a MUST for anyone considering  self-employment or a small business launch.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s  Word &ndash; the Bible &ndash; gives us over 2,000 scriptures relating to finances and the  proper stewardship of the resources we receive from God.&nbsp; These include instructions on honest business  practices, fair treatment of employees, and even advice that relates to  providing excellent customer service.&nbsp; God  wants men and women to succeed in the business world and to be salt and light  to a hurting and lost world.&nbsp; So, if God  is leading you to run a business, small or gigantic, or to join the ranks of  the self-employed, then embrace these two scriptures from Proverbs 16:3 and  21:5 (NIV):</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and  your plans will succeed.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The plans of the diligent lead to  profit as surely as hast leads to poverty.&rdquo;</p>
We encourage you to maximize your understanding  of the business venture you are considering.&nbsp;  Seek wise, godly counsel.&nbsp; The  &ldquo;Legacy Edition of Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus&rdquo; can be used for  individual study or with a small group.&nbsp;  It will provide an excellent starting  point for any potential entrepreneurs or those considering self-employment  opportunities.
