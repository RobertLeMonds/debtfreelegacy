                        <p><span class="articleTitle">A Biblical Giving Plan</span><br>
                          <span class="bold">By Bill & Maureen Sitter</span></p>
                        <p>God knew that 21st century Christians would struggle 
                          with money issues, and that the devil would try to twist 
                          any discussions of tithes, freewill offerings or alms 
                          for the poor. That's why His Word - the Bible - is so 
                          full of scriptural advice in the area of financial stewardship 
                          and giving.</p>
                        <p>We firmly believe that God wants our hearts and not 
                          &quot;our money&quot;. Let's examine 2 Corinthians 9:6-8 
                          (KJV) for insight about the grace He wants to give us, 
                          so we can be blessed and cheerful givers. &quot;But 
                          this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap sparingly; 
                          and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. 
                          Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so 
                          let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity; for God 
                          loveth a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all 
                          grace abound toward you; that ye always having all sufficiency 
                          in all things, may abound to every good work.&quot; 
                          In verse 8:7, God again speaks of us excelling in the 
                          grace of giving.</p>
                        <p>Picture two hearts. One has Jesus at the center and 
                          one has a dollar sign. What's the point? If God has 
                          our full attention, we will make good use of &quot;His 
                          Money&quot; - not &quot;our money&quot;. This may be 
                          a huge shift in viewpoints. That's fine, because God 
                          uses His Word and the Holy Spirit to convict us to change, 
                          but never to condemn us.</p>
                        <p>God's money? Yes - Psalm 50:10 &amp; 11 explains that 
                          God owns the cattle on a thousand hills. 1 Corinthians 
                          10:26 and Psalm 24:1 reinforce the fact that the Lord 
                          owns the entire earth and all it contains. Deuteronomy 
                          8:18 further tells us that even our ability to produce 
                          wealth (any talent we possess) is a gift from God. In 
                          this context - knowing that all we have or ever will 
                          possess comes from God - it is much easier to get our 
                          hearts tender about giving.</p>
                        <p>In the book Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus, a full 
                          chapter is devoted to developing a three-part Biblical 
                          Giving Plan. Briefly, let's touch on paying tithes, 
                          giving freewill offerings, and sowing alms.</p>
                        <p>Paying tithes is both an Old and New Testament concept. 
                          Malachi 3:8-12 is most often referenced (please read 
                          all five verses). The Word speaks of robbing God, and 
                          of bringing the whole tithe into the &quot;storehouse&quot; 
                          (church where you are fed); and of testing God who promises 
                          to rebuke the devourer (devil) and to pour out blessings. 
                          In Matthew 23:23, Jesus reinforced the ten percent tithe 
                          when he rebuked the Pharises. They were tithing on garden 
                          plants and not showing justice, mercy and faithfulness. 
                          He exhorted them to tithe but to also display righteousness 
                          in their daily lives. Proverbs 3:8-10 promises health, 
                          if we honor the Lord with our first fruits.</p>
                        <p>Today, most believers are not farmers so we tithe from 
                          our income. We encourage you to pray (together if married) 
                          and seek God's wisdom. We are confident that you will 
                          desire to pay the ten percent first fruits tithe to 
                          God. Your church is the ideal recipient of the full 
                          tithe because that is your &quot;storehouse&quot;, where 
                          you are spiritually fed.</p>
                        <p>Freewill offerings are in addition to the tithe and 
                          the amount and timing are up to you. We do urge married 
                          couples to agree and to involve children in the giving 
                          plan, as this develops young hearts to be giving hearts. 
                          Jesus told His disciples, in Matthew 28:19&amp;20 to 
                          go and preach the salvation message (Great Commission) 
                          to the world. In <br>
                          1 Corinthians 9:14 Paul explains that preachers of the 
                          gospel should be funded by other believers. Today, there 
                          are many churches, ministries and missionaries who spread 
                          the good news of salvation. Pray and seek the Holy Spirit's 
                          guidance on where and how you should give, beyond the 
                          tithe.</p>
                        <p>Alms are sown for the poor, for widows, and orphans. 
                          There are a number of fine Christian and civil charitable 
                          organizations - such as the Red Cross and the Salvation 
                          Army. See the following scriptures: Proverbs 19:17 and 
                          22:9, 1 Timothy 5:16, and Luke 12:33 &amp; 34. Then 
                          put faith into action!</p>
                        <p>Develop and execute your own giving plan. Include all 
                          three: tithes, offerings, and alms as vital elements 
                          in your commitment to Christian stewardship.</p>
                        <p>Water your giving - your seed - with prayer and scripture. 
                          Give from the heart, with joy; and keep your giving 
                          private, in accordance with Matthew 6: 1&amp;2.</p>
                        <p>Expect God to multiply your seed because He is the 
                          inventor of &quot;heavenly math&quot;. That's right, 
                          in Matthew 13:23 (the Parable of the Sower), Jesus spoke 
                          of 30, 60 or 100 fold returns for seed sown in good 
                          soil. Use your calculator and see that this equates 
                          to 3,000%, 6,000% and 10,000% returns. Now, we don't 
                          know how God will multiply the seed, and we never want 
                          to try to manipulate God. But, somewhere He will do 
                          the math and a small seed will produce a big harvest. 
                          This kind of giving blesses others and blesses the giver.</p>
