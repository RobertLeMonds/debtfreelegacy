                          <span class="bold">By Glen Becker</span><br>
                          <span class="italicRed">Article 3 of 3</span></p>
                        <p>The good news is that Americans  as a whole are a forgiving people.&nbsp; This  is not a cultural phenomenon:&nbsp; it comes  directly from our Christian heritage.&nbsp;  Those whose misdeeds caused problems for themselves and others can now  start over.&nbsp; The Book of Proverbs, often  called "The Book of Wisdom," provides advice on how Christians should act and  react.&nbsp; Responsible, godly behavior  entails making behavioral changes that will help turn around the financial  crisis one household at a time.</p>
                        <p>Of course, the United States  Government is stepping in with massive bailouts.&nbsp; Despite repeated accusations, the Federal  Government is not using this crisis as an excuse to take over the economy and  lead us into Socialism.&nbsp; In fact, the Government  does not claim that their action will correct the problem.&nbsp; Their only motive is to prevent massive  bankruptcies that may have brought down the entire economy.&nbsp; One Congressman who voted for the bailout plan  said, "I had to hold my nose when I voted for this bill, but the alternative is  worse.</p>
                        <p>The various bailout plans create  massive public debt.&nbsp; In effect we are  not solving the crisis, but merely pushing its negative consequences further  into the future. &nbsp;Whether this is wise or  not remains to be seen.</p>
                        <p>The real solution to the crisis  is a massive repentance by the American people.&nbsp;&nbsp; The word "repent" does not mean to feel  sorry for past wrongs, but rather it means to turn the other direction.&nbsp; Slowly and quietly, many Americans are making  changes that will ultimately correct the problem.&nbsp; They are changing their spending habits,  focusing on necessities instead of luxuries; they are spending less and saving  more.&nbsp; Labor unions are making  compromises instead of screaming for  strikes.&nbsp; Banks are still lending, but  are being more careful about it.&nbsp; Our  brief exposure to $4 per gallon gas shifted our car buying   from ever-larger SUVs to more vehicles with good mileage.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that the way out of  our troubles involves productive work, not some magic formula of borrowing and  investing.&nbsp; Many people whose employment  depended on their customers' borrowing money are being   forced to shift to jobs that do not.&nbsp; Wise landlords are shifting their strategies  from quick profits by flipping houses to holding property for long-term  appreciation.&nbsp; None of these things will  quickly increase employment or cause housing prices to rebound.&nbsp; But they will lay the foundation for a solid,  sustainable recovery.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, Christians must  apply the <strong>Principles of Wisdom</strong>  written in Proverbs and lay hold of God's promise, "I have never seen the  righteous forsaken, or their children begging bread.&nbsp; They are always generous and lend  freely."&nbsp; (Psalm 37:25, 26).&nbsp; Many people will need divine bailouts to make  it through layoffs and uncertainty, but God doesn't mind.&nbsp; Scripture uses the term <strong>kinsman-redeemer</strong>, (see Ruth Chapter 3), to describe the  kind, generous relative who bails us out of the messes we get ourselves  into.&nbsp; Jesus is the ultimate  kinsman-redeemer because He is the brother to all who believe.&nbsp; It helps to have close relatives in high  places.</p>
