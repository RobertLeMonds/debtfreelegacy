                        <p>&#8220;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, 
                          by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your 
                          requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends 
                          all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds 
                          in Christ Jesus.&#8221; Philippians 4:6-7 (NIV)</p>
                        <p>Several years ago my husband got laid off from his 
                          job. I was working, but didn&#8217;t earn enough to 
                          cover the bills. We definitely had some financial struggles 
                          and this was really a difficult time for the whole family. 
                          We had three children living at home&#8212;two teenagers 
                          and one engaged to be married. I was seeing a doctor 
                          for back problems and suddenly all of my medications 
                          were cut off. This was not the best time to be laid 
                          off, with college tuition, a wedding, and health issues. 
                          Suddenly, everything we knew to be true had to be put 
                          into practice. </p>
                        <p>Our faith was being tested. Psalms 3:5 (NIV) says, 
                          &#8220;Trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean not 
                          on your own understanding, acknowledge him in all your 
                          ways and HE will direct your steps.&#8221; Trusting 
                          God became an everyday endeavor. At times I found myself 
                          faced with worry instead of trust. I remembered a poem 
                          hanging on my Grandmother&#8217;s wall.</p>
                        <p>Worry never climbed a hill,<br>
                          Worry never paid a bill,<br>
                          Worry never dried a tear,<br>
                          Worry never calmed a fear.<br>
                          Worry never fixed a heel,<br>
                          Worry never cooked a meal,<br>
                          Worry never composed a song to sing,<br>
                          Actually, worry never did a worthwhile thing. (Author 
                          unknown)</p>
                        <p>This poem portrays &#8216;Worry&#8217; as a living 
                          being. And I believe if we let it, Worry will get the 
                          best of us. Worry according to Webster, is to feel uneasy 
                          or anxious; fret; torment oneself with or suffer from 
                          disturbing thoughts.</p>
                        <p>To worry about anything is not trusting God! Worry, 
                          like any fear, runs 100% counter to faith in God and 
                          His promises. When you don&#8217;t trust God, He is 
                          not able to answer prayers. If you have been worried 
                          or struggling with your finances, perhaps you need to 
                          ask God to intervene. He is your provider and He will 
                          make a way for you.</p>
                        <p>Prayer: Lord, Forgive me for trusting in myself and 
                          giving in to worry. Help me to trust my finances and 
                          my life to you. Amen.</p>
