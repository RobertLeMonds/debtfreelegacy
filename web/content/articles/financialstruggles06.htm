                        <p>Most couples have heard that financial problems are 
                          the leading cause of divorce. Yet knowing that has neither 
                          prevented the financial problems nor the divorces. </p>
                        <p>Why not? Because they fall into the common trap of 
                          thinking that the solution to money problems is more 
                          money, and since many already make all the money they 
                          can, they shrug their shoulders and concede that nothing 
                          can be done about the problem. </p>
                        <p>Others work harder and longer for more money, only 
                          to find that doing so does not strengthen the marriage; 
                          it weakens it. Eating out and extravagant spending will 
                          not mend a marriage. Only dealing with heart issues 
                          will bring down the walls that separate and divide. 
                          Gifts provide only temporary happiness that is soon 
                          forgotten when wounded hearts keep a couple apart. Marriage 
                          and finances&#8230;those two subjects seem to surface 
                          all too often in marital disputes.</p>
                        <p>No one wants to stay on a sinking ship; as soon as 
                          he believes his ship is going down, he makes plans to 
                          get off anyway he can. Financial problems make a marriage 
                          seem like a slowly sinking ship as the couple sinks 
                          deeper into debt and loses all hope of rising out of 
                          it. As their ship sinks, they start thinking of themselves, 
                          spending for themselves and planning for their post-divorce 
                          financial lives.</p>
                        <p>Yet some couples enjoy strong, happy marriages &#8211; 
                          even those that have very little money, or face very 
                          difficult financial challenges. How do they do it? They 
                          know a biblical secret: that unity and common purpose 
                          have real power that can overcome the most difficult 
                          problems. </p>
                        <p>We have known couples that have towering debt, who 
                          could not talk about their finances without arguing, 
                          become filled with hope and purpose when they started 
                          praying and planning together. Their income did not 
                          change, their debts are still large, but now they speak 
                          with excitement about paying off their first high-interest 
                          loan. They already know the date, and have made a detailed 
                          spending and debt payment plan that will enable them 
                          to do it. Their final debt-freedom date is still far 
                          in the future, but they do not have to wait until then 
                          to celebrate their success. Their ship is no longer 
                          sinking, it&#8217;s rising!</p>
                        <p>A one-flesh couple walks together as one in God&#8217;s 
                          will and purpose. They submit to one another in love 
                          out of reverence to God. They give up individual wants 
                          and desires for the sake of their marriage and family, 
                          and to strive for a higher purpose and call in Christ.</p>
                        <p>Is your ship sinking? Have you become divided in your 
                          view of your finances? If so, God has a better plan. 
                          Pray that he would unite your heart with his purposes 
                          for your finances. Ask him to heal your heart of selfishness 
                          and doubt that may have led to past offenses and to 
                          give you and your spouse a fresh vision and a new hope 
                          for your financial life. Ask him to show you how to 
                          walk together as a one-flesh couple. Marriage and finances, 
                          the Word of God has much to say about both topics and 
                          how they should work together for the joy of the couple 
                          and for God&#8217;s pleasure.</p>
