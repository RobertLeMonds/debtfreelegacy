                        <p><span class="articleTitle">Over Withholding - A Loan You Cannot Afford</span><br>
                          <span class="bold">by Glen Becker</span></p>
                        <p>Suppose your uncle made you this offer: &#8220;Every 
                          time you get a paycheck, send me $50 or $100. Then, 
                          next spring, you can spend hours filling out long, complicated 
                          paperwork that proves to me that I owe you money. Mail 
                          them in, and after a few weeks, I will give you back 
                          the money that you loaned me, but not a penny more. 
                          If you keep sending me money after January 1st, you 
                          won&#8217;t get any of that back until the year after.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>No way! Why would you want to do that? Why loan money 
                          to your uncle interest-free, while you are paying 18% 
                          to 24% plus interest to banks for your credit cards?</p>
                        <p>Yet most Americans do exactly that. They loan money 
                          each payday to Uncle Sam, and even though he does not 
                          really want the loan, they insist on lending it anyway. 
                          Most Americans live under the illusion that a big tax 
                          refund is a good thing, that they have somehow gotten 
                          a nice, big bonus from Uncle Sam. </p>
                        <p>That is false. That tax refund is your money, which 
                          you loaned to the government interest-free. You earned 
                          it, and you have the choice of what to do with it. Even 
                          the IRS recommends that you lower your withholding if 
                          you get a large tax refund. See page 2 of IRS Publication 
                          919 at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p919.pdf. </p>
                        <p>Does it really matter? Why not get that nice refund? 
                          God instead asks you, &#8220;What is your motive for 
                          wanting one?&#8221; To answer that question, remember 
                          what you did with past refunds. If you are like most 
                          Americans, you used it for an impulse purchase, such 
                          as a big-screen TV, or down payment on a new car. Scripture 
                          says, &#8220;The plans of the diligent lead to profit 
                          as surely as haste leads to poverty.&#8221; (Prov 27:23, 
                          NIV). Big refunds are generally not planned; they are 
                          the result of a common mistake: if you own a house, 
                          and give even a small percentage of your income to your 
                          church or charity, claiming one exemption per family 
                          member withholds more than necessary. Haste, on the 
                          other hand, is readily evident once the refund check 
                          arrives.</p>
                        <p>You can correct this problem immediately. You may fill 
                          out a new W-4 anytime you find that you are having too 
                          much or too little tax withheld. Form W-4 and its instructions 
                          are available at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf. Page 
                          2 has worksheets that will help you get the correct 
                          number of exemptions if you itemize your deductions 
                          or have more than one wage earner. Do not be shocked 
                          if the correct number of exemptions seems high. The 
                          IRS does not care how many exemptions you claim on form 
                          W-4 as long as you withhold (or make estimation payments 
                          for) at least 90% of your actual tax. Aim for 100% or 
                          just over, so that when you file your tax return, you 
                          will either receive or pay a small amount.</p>
                        <p>You will see the results in your paycheck almost immediately. 
                          You can then use your money according to God&#8217;s 
                          priorities, and the plans you and He make together.</p>
