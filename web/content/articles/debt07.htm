                          <span class="bold">By Glen Becker</span></p>
                        <p>You have  probably seen or heard advertisements that say: "We have access to secret  programs the credit card companies don't want you do know about.&nbsp; We can settle your credit card debt for just  pennies for every dollar you owe.&nbsp;&nbsp; You  must owe at least $10,000 to qualify, so call now!" </p>
                        <p>You may have  thought, "Golly, I only owe $7,000.&nbsp;  Maybe if I take a vacation or buy a big-screen TV, I could charge-up  enough to qualify for this wonderful opportunity!"&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a little voice inside of you says,  "Don't believe it.&nbsp; You cannot get out  of debt by borrowing more!"&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Before going  further, let's clarify the scenario we are addressing. A person has incurred  debt with the promise to repay according to a written or verbal agreement.  Regardless of who the money is owed to, a Christian has obligated himself to  fulfill his part of the bargain &ndash; to repay. So let's consider options in the  following paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>These "secret  programs" are targeted at people who appear to be on the verge of  bankruptcy.&nbsp; Credit card companies know  that in bankruptcy, they would probably get nothing, so they may be willing to  settle a debt for 30&cent; to 70&cent; on the dollar.&nbsp;  If you really are close to bankruptcy, you are better advised to  personally pursue a voluntary settlement with your creditors, because it  is faster and less expensive than bankruptcy; and you don't need to engage a  debt relief agency to do this for you.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Of course,  you could always call your creditors and say, "Listen, I'm broke and if I  declare bankruptcy, you get zilch, so you better take 30&cent; on the dollar."&nbsp; You could even try to justify this approach  by reminding God the creditor you just threatened is "voluntarily" settling the  debt, so righteousness requires no additional (full) repayment.&nbsp; But God is not fooled by this kind of  arrogant manipulation; a haughty attitude towards God and man cannot be God's  plan for financial blessing.</p>
                        <p>Of course, if  you hire a debt negotiator, he/she will most likely speak to your creditors in  a professional way, but the message will often be the same.&nbsp; In fact, he will probably try to portray your  situation as bad as he can make it, especially if his fee is a percentage of  the dollars he saves you.&nbsp; He may say:  "My client's financial future is so bleak that he could not possibly pay 65&cent; on  each dollar.&nbsp; The best you can hope for  is 30&cent;."&nbsp; That doubles the debtor's  savings from 35% to 70% of the amount owed, which might double the debt relief  negotiator's fee.</p>
                        <p>I cannot imagine  hiring someone to speak such financial curses on me.&nbsp; A person may not be in a current position to  pay the full amount, but a Christian wants anyone who represents him to  sincerely seek God's best for him, and to honestly deal with all parties  involved.&nbsp; A just settlement is far  better than a cheap settlement based on manipulation.</p>
                        <p>Professional  debt negotiators often insist that when you finally settle the debt, you do so  in a lump sum payment.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if you owe  $10,000 that you cannot pay, how will find $5,000 to settle the debt?&nbsp; Or $1,500 more to pay the negotiator's  fee?&nbsp;&nbsp; He would tell you to save it up,  or to get it from relatives.&nbsp; He may  insist that you let him hold it until the full amount is ready to pay.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, he does not pay interest, and is not FDIC insured.</p>
                        <p>Yes,  creditors have different policies concerning debt workout plans, but it would  seem better to work out a payment plan that shows slow, steady progress than to  wait for $6,500 to fall out of the sky.&nbsp;  If you owe multiple creditors, a negotiator might tell you to let him  lump your debts together or to repeat this process as necessary for up to three  years.&nbsp; Then, and only then, would you be  able to start rebuilding your trashed credit rating.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>But, if you  work out a reasonable (fair &amp; honest) payment plan with your creditors,  then they should report your payments to the credit bureaus and your credit  rating should begin to gradually improve.&nbsp;  It certainly is worth your time to personally contact your creditors and  honestly explain your situation, tell them you have a Spending Plan that allows  you to pay your debt at a certain rate, and ask for their favor in reducing the  interest, late fees and if necessary, the principal.</p>
                        <p>Any deal that  seems too good to be true probably is.&nbsp;  Taking advantage of a "secret program" to settle a debt for only 30&cent; on  the dollar sounds great until you count the true cost.&nbsp;&nbsp; God's not-so-secret program of rewarding the  honest, diligent person with blessings and favor sounds far better. </p>
                        <p><em>Proverbs 22:1&nbsp; A  good name is to be more desired than great wealth, Favor is better than silver  and gold (NAS). </em></p>
