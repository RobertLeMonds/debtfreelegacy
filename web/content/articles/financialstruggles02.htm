                        <p>Have you ever considered what you truly believe about 
                          your finances? Have you ever thought about what it means 
                          to prosper? Do you really believe you can be completely 
                          debt free? Can you visualize it? How does it feel? </p>
                        <p>Too often we don&#8217;t actually consider what we 
                          personally believe about a subject. We develop strongholds 
                          in our minds that may be acquired because of our family 
                          backgrounds. A stronghold is defined as a way of thinking 
                          or systems of beliefs contrary to the will of God. </p>
                        <p>For example, many Christians grow up believing prosperity 
                          is a sin. After all, isn&#8217;t money the root of all 
                          evil? The Bible actually states &#8220;the love of money 
                          is the root of all evil&#8221;. (I Tim. 6:10 - Amplified) 
                          A person can actually love money whether they are financially 
                          wealthy or not. A person can spend an inordinate amount 
                          of time trying to gain, save or invest money and neglect 
                          the priorities of spending time with God and with their 
                          family. In fact, the Lord wants us to prosper. (3 John 
                          2 (KJ) &#8211; &#8220;Beloved, I wish above all things 
                          that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy 
                          soul prospereth&#8221;. How can the Lord want us to 
                          prosper and allow prosperity to be a sin? </p>
                        <p>Another example may be the belief that being prosperous 
                          means having a good job, paying our bills on time and 
                          having good credit so we can borrow money in case of 
                          an emergency. The reality is that being prosperous is 
                          defined as having enough time, talent and money to do 
                          what God has called us to do. Can you see how true prosperity 
                          has to do with God&#8217;s purposes for finances and 
                          not our own selfish purposes for finances? </p>
                        <p>Probably the most destructive stronghold in our mind 
                          about finances is the belief that it is our own talent, 
                          time and strength that is the cause of our prosperity. 
                          Instead, the reality is that it is God who has given 
                          us the ability to get wealth, and not we ourselves. 
                          Deut. 8:17-19 &#8211; (ESV) &#8220;Beware lest you say 
                          in your heart, 'My power and the might of my hand have 
                          gotten me this wealth.' 18You shall remember the LORD 
                          your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth 
                          that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your 
                          fathers, as it is this day. 19And if you forget the 
                          LORD your God and go after other gods and serve them 
                          and worship them, I solemnly warn you today that you 
                          shall surely perish.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>To destroy our strongholds, we need to spend concerted 
                          time considering what we actually believe about our 
                          finances. We need to spend time in God&#8217;s word 
                          and see what He says about prosperity and finances. 
                          When we realize the many strongholds we have in our 
                          mind, we need to turn to the Lord and ask Him to renew 
                          our minds and break those previous strongholds. For 
                          Jeremiah 29:11 tells us that God&#8217;s plan is for 
                          us to prosper and to give us a future and hope.</p>
                        <p>For me, I was able to spend some concerted effort reviewing 
                          these issues while going through the Financial Freedom 
                          in 7 Weeks Plus course. Prior to this course, I had 
                          no idea how far away my plans were from God&#8217;s 
                          best plans for my finances. The workbook and forms allowed 
                          me to have a basis of comparison, a place to start, 
                          if you will, to begin to allow the Lord to renew my 
                          mind in this critical area in my life. Get the workbook 
                          and, if at all possible, join a 7 week focus group soon. 
                          How long will it take you to finally get on the right 
                          path to prosperity? God is so gracious. The choice is 
                          yours. </p>
