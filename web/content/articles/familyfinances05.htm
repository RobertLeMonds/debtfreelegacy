                        <p>&#8220;Train a child in the way he should go, and when 
                          he is old he will not turn from it.&#8221; Proverbs 
                          22:6 (NIV)</p>
                        <p>This is a scriptural principle that applies to every 
                          area of life including finances. As parents we can train 
                          our children to be cheerful givers, to trust God to 
                          supply their needs, and to be generous in giving.</p>
                        <p>As a child, I was taught to save and taught to give. 
                          My Mom and Dad gave me a metal can to keep my allowance 
                          in. For every dollar I received, ten cents was put aside 
                          for Sunday School offering. I loved to take my money 
                          on Sunday morning and put it in the Sunday School church 
                          bank. I felt good inside as I dropped my coins into 
                          the bank. If I forgot my offering, I felt very sad and 
                          I knew that God was sad too. I know now that God loves 
                          a cheerful giver and we have taught our children the 
                          same. II Cor. 9:7b (NIV) </p>
                        <p>When our oldest son, Stephen, was a child he attended 
                          a mission conference with us and put a few dollars in 
                          the offering plate. This was all he had, but it was 
                          a simple act of obedience in response to a call to give. 
                          We were proud of his response, but couldn&#8217;t return 
                          the blessing to him at the time, because we were about 
                          to depart on a mission trip. (We also realize, now, 
                          that we were not obligated to &#8220;play God.&#8221;) 
                          While we were gone, Stephen stayed with his grandparents 
                          and earned $170 doing yard work. I was amazed at God&#8217;s 
                          abundant blessing. The Bible says, &#8220;Give and it 
                          shall be given unto you. Good measure, pressed down, 
                          and shaken together and running over shall men give 
                          into your bosom...&#8221; Luke 6:38 (KJV)</p>
                        <p>As a child, Stephen learned the joys of giving and 
                          that God does supply our needs. Today, as a young adult, 
                          Stephen continues to be a generous giver. God has blessed 
                          him with a comfortable job that pays well. In addition, 
                          he receives an annual bonus that is more that half his 
                          annual salary. Stephen has learned the secret of giving 
                          and God has blessed him abundantly in his generous heart 
                          to give.</p>
                        <p>Giving into the Kingdom of God is one of the most important 
                          things we can teach our children to do. It will cause 
                          them to reap a blessing today and reap an abundant harvest 
                          for many years to come. What better heritage can we 
                          pass on to our children than Kingdom giving?</p>
