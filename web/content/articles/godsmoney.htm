                        <p>You read correctly, and yes this does include your 
                          finances. And now you may be asking yourself, &#8220;Did 
                          I miss something when I asked Jesus Christ to come into 
                          my heart?&#8221; Actually, no you didn&#8217;t because 
                          as far as God is concerned you&#8217;re His heir to 
                          the throne, and joint heir with His son Jesus. Romans 
                          8:17 (KJ) says it this way &#8220;And if children, then 
                          heirs; heirs of God , and joint heirs with Christ; if 
                          so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified 
                          together&#8221;.</p>
                        <p>Wow! I know this rubs our western way of thinking to 
                          the core. Everything we&#8217;ve been taught outside 
                          of our new life with Christ says: &#8220;Be independent; 
                          get all you can, while you can, and keep it all for 
                          yourself.&#8221; Unfortunately, this is a self centered 
                          lifestyle, and God expects our focus, as His sons and 
                          daughters, to be selfless and focused outward.</p>
                        <p>Now that I am a Christian (a follower of Jesus Christ) 
                          my life is no longer my own. It is imperative that I 
                          find out who God is and how He thinks. The only way 
                          I can do this is by getting in His Holy Word daily and 
                          allowing the Holy Spirit per 1 John 4:4 to speak to 
                          me inwardly. John 16:13, (KJ) says &#8220;the Holy Spirit 
                          will guide you into all truth&#8221;. As you do this 
                          you will begin to gain revelation about what Psalm 24:1 
                          means, &#8220;The earth is the Lord&#8217;s, and the 
                          fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell within&#8221;. 
                          (KJ).</p>
                        <p>Over time, as you mature in the things of God, you 
                          will learn that it&#8217;s no longer about you, rather 
                          it&#8217;s about God using you to affect His kingdom 
                          in a positive way. Your focus will become much more 
                          about being a blessing to others. As Ephesians 1:2-6 
                          (Message) says: &#8220;I, Paul, am under God's plan 
                          as an apostle, a special agent of Christ Jesus, writing 
                          to you faithful believers in Ephesus. I greet you with 
                          the grace and peace poured into our lives by God our 
                          Father and our Master, Jesus Christ. How blessed is 
                          God! And what a blessing he is! He's the Father of our 
                          Master, Jesus Christ, and takes us to the high places 
                          of blessing in him. Long before he laid down earth's 
                          foundations, he had us in mind, had settled on us as 
                          the focus of his love, to be made whole and holy by 
                          his love. Long, long ago he decided to adopt us into 
                          his family through Jesus Christ. (What pleasure he took 
                          in planning this!) He wanted us to enter into the celebration 
                          of his lavish gift-giving by the hand of his beloved 
                          Son.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>See yourself as God&#8217;s conduits here on earth, 
                          whereby He can distribute through you all that He owns 
                          to those in need. How awesome is that? I&#8217;d say 
                          very. Why? &#8211; Because God wants to use us in a 
                          very significant way to impact this world we&#8217;re 
                          a part of, simply for the kingdom&#8217;s sake, so that 
                          people may receive Him. We all have assignments regarding 
                          spreading &#8220;The Great Commission&#8221; and that 
                          mandates excellent stewardship of God&#8217;s resources, 
                          which He entrusts to us.</p>
                        <p>Consider how revolutionary this is in the face of all 
                          that looms around you everyday. In the midst of all 
                          the chaos you and I, as God&#8217;s ambassadors, will 
                          stand out like beacons on a hill as we unconditionally 
                          take care of and bless those who are without.</p>

                          Why? Because we took this step a few months ago and 
                          now we&#8217;re finally on the same page, discussing 
                          and developing our spending plan for our home. It only 
                          took 14 years; so don&#8217;t delay and go around this 
                          financial mountain like we did, living in turmoil and 
                          despair. Married couples need to heed God&#8217;s clear 
                          instructions per Ephesians 5:31 (Amplified) &#8220;And 
                          the two shall become one flesh.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>The workbook Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus was 
                          and is the &#8220;tool&#8221; we&#8217;ve prayed for 
                          all these years and is now helping us to begin the process 
                          of building a legacy of debt freedom which we could 
                          not foresee. Hosea 4:6, (Amplified) says &#8220;My people 
                          are destroyed for lack of knowledge&#8221;. Why not 
                          begin working on your finances&#8230; today?</p>
