                          <span class="bold">By Amber Drabek</span></p>
                        <p>I never dreamed that I would be stuck in a financial 
                          hole, as deep as I was, three years ago. God had led 
                          me to a new chapter in life and to a new city. However, 
                          the choices I had made financially finally caught up 
                          with me. Whenever I felt empty inside, I would grab 
                          my credit card and start spending. I needed my God to 
                          fill that empty place inside of me&#8212;not material 
                          possessions! God placed it on my heart that He had plans 
                          for my life and they were beyond anything I could ever 
                          imagine! Jeremiah 29:11 (AMP): &#8220;For I know the 
                          thoughts and plans I have for you, says the Lord, thoughts 
                          and plans for welfare and peace and not for evil, to 
                          give you hope in your final outcome.&#8221; However, 
                          the question that I had for myself was: How can these 
                          plans come to fruition if my god was a credit card?</p>
                        <p>The Lord came to my rescue once again and led me to 
                          the Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus book and course. 
                          God used this program to show me ways to control my 
                          spending and my cash flow. A cash flow system is a way 
                          to keep track of where your money goes and how it is 
                          spent, saved, or wasted. One of these cash flow systems 
                          is an envelope system. A flexible spending plan is projected 
                          and planned to allot specific funds to specific spending 
                          categories. Some examples of these categories are as 
                          follows: groceries, rent, clothing, entertainment, and 
                          savings. </p>
                        <p>Now, to use the envelope system, take your envelopes 
                          and label them with these specific spending categories. 
                          You can use whatever category you choose, but those 
                          that you have a more difficult time controlling are 
                          great places to start. Once you receive your paycheck, 
                          place the allotted cash monies into the envelopes. A 
                          log sheet or register should be used, for each envelope, 
                          to track incoming and outgoing monies. If your spending 
                          plan is balanced with a positive monthly cash flow, 
                          then there should exist sufficient monies for each envelope. 
                          Once the funds from an envelope are used, then spending 
                          from that category must be stopped for that time period. 
                          Money can be transferred from one category to another, 
                          if need be. However, new debt is not an option. Restraint 
                          and discipline are required for the system to work properly.</p>
                        <p>A simple envelope cash flow control system has enabled 
                          me to avoid the use of credit cards and stop overspending. 
                          This has been imperative for me to remain on a road 
                          to complete financial freedom and to achievement of 
                          God&#8217;s life plan for me. Of course, for anything 
                          to flourish and prosper in life, God has to remain in 
                          the center. I have to continually pray and to remain 
                          in God&#8217;s Word. &#8220;Then you will seek Me, inquire 
                          for, and require Me and find Me, when you search for 
                          Me with all your heart.&#8221; Jeremiah 29:13 (AMP)
