                        <p><span class="articleTitle">Savings and Planning … Should Christians bother?</span><br>
                          <span class="bold">By Bill & Maureen Sitter</span></p>
                        <p>Saving for the future and financial goal setting - 
                          both concepts are often questioned by well meaning Christians. 
                          They ask - &quot;Shouldn't we trust entirely in God? 
                          After all, He takes care of the birds, the animals, 
                          and He makes the beautiful flowers.&quot;</p>
                        <p>In today's turbulent economical times, it is easy to 
                          see the importance of having a savings reserve and this 
                          only happens as part of a sound financial goal setting 
                          process. Okay - that's practical advice, but what about 
                          God's advice? Glad you asked - so lets' turn to scripture.</p>
                        <p>The savings concept is portrayed clearly in Proverbs 
                          21:20 and Proverbs 6:8 (NIV): &quot;In the house of 
                          the wise are stores of choice food and oil, but a foolish 
                          man devours all he has.&quot; &quot;Go to the ant you 
                          sluggard: consider its ways and be wise! It has no commander, 
                          no overseer, or ruler, yet it stores its provisions 
                          in summer and gathers its food at harvest.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Planning is clearly God ordained and we are to have 
                          Godly motives in our goal setting. Proverbs 21:5 (NIV) 
                          &quot;The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely 
                          as haste leads to poverty. And, Proverbs 16:3 (NIV) 
                          &quot;Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans 
                          will succeed.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Jesus gave us an illustration of the need for preplanning, 
                          for both personal and business projects, in Luke 14:28-30 
                          (NKJ) &quot;For which of you, intending to build a tower, 
                          does not sit down first and count the cost, whether 
                          he has enough to finish it - lest, after he has laid 
                          the foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see 
                          it begin to mock him, saying, 'This man began to build 
                          and was not able to finish'.&quot;</p>
                        <p>Sequential strategies for saving and investing are 
                          reduced to ten simple steps in the book - Financial 
                          Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus. These steps are taught in a 
                          7 week program which starts with goal setting and a 
                          biblical giving plan foundation and progresses through 
                          a freedom from debt plan, to a balanced spending plan, 
                          and concludes with a cash flow control plan - called 
                          - &quot;Keeping Track of God's Money&quot;.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, God intends for His people to: plan, to save, 
                          to give, and to be able to do all that He has called 
                          us to do. So, in the end, we will hear Jesus say these 
                          wonderful words from the Parable of the Talents, Matthew 
                          25:20-21 (KJV) &quot;Well done thou good and faithful 
                          servant &#8230; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.&quot;</p>
