                        <p>My Pastor often tells us to look at our friends and 
                          the people we hang-out with. They are an indication 
                          of who we are and where we are going. So, I decided 
                          to take a look at my closest friends. I noticed that 
                          God has blessed each and every one of them! Let's look 
                          at some of the reasons why:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>They ALL bless other people. </li>
                          <li>They all are servants.</li>
                          <li> They all give their tithes.</li>
                          <li> Even though they do not have to, they all give 
                            additional freewill offerings.</li>
                          <li> They all give their time and talents for the glory 
                            of the Kingdom of God. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>That inspires me to want to do the same thing!</p>
                        <p>Offerings are not always about money, but also include 
                          your time and talents. This is not always about the 
                          big, huge talents that get a lot of recognition. Some 
                          quietly cook for the homeless ministry twice a month. 
                          Some teach small groups. Some run cameras at church. 
                          Some are ushers or pray for others during altar calls. 
                          Even just holding a door open for an elderly couple 
                          counts as an offering. There are several different areas 
                          where you can give an offering and they all serve as 
                          worship towards the Father. Yes, cooking for the homeless 
                          is worship! God is honored and He is well pleased with 
                          unselfish service. </p>
                        <p>Proverbs 19:17 (NKJV) says, &quot;He who has pity on 
                          the poor lends to the LORD, and He will pay back what 
                          he has given.&quot; God will even pay you back for what 
                          you offered-up, so you can continue to bless others. 
                          God loves to bless His children!</p>
                        <p>If you are having trouble getting started, or wonder 
                          where you can start to bless other people, start hanging 
                          out with friends that do bless others. It will FIRE 
                          you up. It will inspire you!</p>
                        <p>If you do not have friends like that, start praying 
                          to God to send you Godly friends that will inspire you. 
                          Godly friends can also hold you accountable. When I 
                          started tithing, I was accountable to a couple who was 
                          mentoring me. After several months, tithing became a 
                          natural habit. They helped me to stay on track at the 
                          beginning.</p>
                        <p>Godly friends will inspire you and soon you will be 
                          an inspiration to others.</p>
