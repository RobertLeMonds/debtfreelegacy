                        <p>My parents never talked to me about tithing, giving, 
                          or the sowing of alms. I went to church only when my 
                          parents felt like taking me. My only example of biblical 
                          giving while growing up was when the offering plate 
                          came around; dad would reach in his wallet and drop 
                          in a $20 bill, since they only took me to church for 
                          Vacation Bible School, Christmas and Easter, I did not 
                          develop an understanding of responsible biblical giving. 
                          When I began to understand what God&#8217;s Word says 
                          about biblical giving, I fully realized it was my responsibility 
                          to pass on a legacy of financial principles to our children 
                          so that their children&#8217;s children would walk in 
                          the prosperity of God&#8217;s promises.</p>
                        <p>I like what The Message Bible says in Malachi 3:8-10 
                          about being blessed or cursed when we tithe or don&#8217;t 
                          tithe. &#8220;Begin by being honest. Do honest people 
                          rob God? But you rob me day after day. You ask, How 
                          have we robbed you? The tithe and the offering&#8212;that's 
                          how! And now you're under a curse &#8212;the whole lot 
                          of you&#8212;because you're robbing me. Bring your full 
                          tithe to the Temple treasury so there will be ample 
                          provisions in my Temple. Test me in this and see if 
                          I don't open up heaven itself to you and pour out blessings 
                          beyond your wildest dreams. For my part, I will defend 
                          you against marauders, protect your wheat fields and 
                          vegetable gardens against plunderers.&quot; </p>
                        <p>When both of our children began to receive monies, 
                          we taught them the principle of the tithe. When they 
                          cheerfully gave of their tithe, they received blessings. 
                          When they withheld their tithe, they got dropped from 
                          their work schedule, or got their hours reduced. They 
                          quickly learned and lived the lessons of Malachi. Have 
                          you passed the torch of biblical giving to your children? 
                          What have you modeled in your generation that will carry 
                          on from generation to generation? <br>
                          The Message Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 9:6-8: </p>
                        <p>&#8220;Remember: A stingy planter gets a stingy crop; 
                          a lavish planter gets a lavish crop. I want each of 
                          you to take plenty of time to think it over, and make 
                          up your own mind what you will give. That will protect 
                          you against sob stories and arm-twisting. God loves 
                          it when the giver delights in the giving. God can pour 
                          on the blessings in astonishing ways so that you're 
                          ready for anything and everything, more than just ready 
                          to do what needs to be done. As one psalmist puts it, 
                          He throws caution to the winds, giving to the needy 
                          in reckless abandon. His right-living, right-giving 
                          ways never run out, never wear out. This most generous 
                          God who gives seed to the farmer that becomes bread 
                          for your meals is more than extravagant with you. He 
                          gives you something you can then give away, which grows 
                          into full-formed lives, robust in God, wealthy in every 
                          way, so that you can be generous in every way, producing 
                          with us great praise to God.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>As covenant-keeping Christians, it&#8217;s our responsibility 
                          to learn what God&#8217;s Word says about resources, 
                          tithing and giving beyond the tithe. God owns everything 
                          and He is our only source of resources. Our children
