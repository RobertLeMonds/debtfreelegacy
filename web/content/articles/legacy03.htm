                        <p><span class="articleTitle">Leaving a Financial Legacy</span><br>
                          <span class="bold">by Glen Becker</span></p>
                        <p>Most people think that only the rich can leave a legacy 
                          to their children and following generations. Since most 
                          people are not rich, they never think about their legacy.</p>
                        <p>Actually, all people leave a legacy. Your real legacy 
                          is not your money and property; it is your faith and 
                          your values. These in turn not only determine how you 
                          handle your finances, but also influence how your heirs 
                          will handle theirs. If your wealth has grown because 
                          of careful planning and management, then your children&#8217;s 
                          wealth will likely grow for the same reasons. </p>
                        <p>But if careless spending or irresponsible investing 
                          has left you in debt, your children will likely fall 
                          into the same traps. If you have experienced the pain 
                          of harassing bill collectors, or the nightmare of bankruptcy, 
                          it hurts to imagine your children having to endure them, 
                          too.</p>
                        <p>Think of the legacy you would like to leave them. You 
                          want them to be able to live within their means, to 
                          be free of debt, to plan and save for the future, and 
                          to be generous. You cannot give someone else something 
                          you do not have yourself. So, to pass these blessings 
                          on to your heirs, you must have them yourself, or at 
                          least be well on the way to getting them.</p>
                        <p>One of our great-grandfathers left a wonderful financial 
                          legacy. He came to Texas in the 1880&#8217;s from Germany 
                          with nothing. He failed as a laborer because he could 
                          not work in the Texas heat. Not knowing English, the 
                          only work he could find was a low-paying job at a boarding 
                          house. </p>
                        <p>He and a friend hoped to make money selling refreshments 
                          and souvenirs to the crowds that would come to Austin 
                          for the dedication of the new state capitol. The crowds 
                          did not come, and there was no way to repay the money 
                          they had borrowed to finance the venture. The friend 
                          skipped town, but my great-grandfather cared about his 
                          legacy. He may not have been thinking about how his 
                          actions would affect his descendents more than 100 years 
                          later, but they did, and in a big way.</p>
                        <p>He chose to repay the debt. It took him years, but 
                          he did it. Afterwards, he opened a lunch counter, then 
                          later a lumber company, and died a fairly wealthy man, 
                          leaving not only a legacy of money, but a legacy of 
                          generosity, having made several important gifts to the 
                          city. Most importantly, my family has passed on the 
                          legacy of generosity and honesty and avoiding debt. 
                          Oh yes, we did inherit some money, though not nearly 
                          enough to live on. The true riches were not the dollars, 
                          but the legacy. Proverbs 13:22 (NIV) says, &#8220;A 
                          good man leaves an inheritance for his children&#8217;s 
                          children.&#8221; </p>
                        <p>The Lord can do through you what He did through our 
                          ancestor. Everything you do, each decision you make 
                          builds your legacy. But the most important, long-lasting 
                          part of your legacy is choosing to do what is right 
                          when it is difficult or expensive. Even the little daily 
                          decisions determine your legacy when they are added 
                          together. Ask God to give you the wisdom and power to 
                          leave this kind of legacy to your heirs. </p>
