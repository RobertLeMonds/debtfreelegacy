                        <p>My church home is presently building a new sanctuary 
                          in my city. We have seen the blueprints, the dream, 
                          and the plan evolve into an actual building. The sanctuary 
                          is presently close to completion. It will be such a 
                          grand event to walk into the finished structure and 
                          to call it my new church home. The church will be able 
                          to leave a legacy for generations to come, and that&#8217;s 
                          exciting. However, could you imagine if those blueprints 
                          and plans never were actually completed? They would 
                          be just dreams and ideas that never came to pass. </p>
                        <p>As part of the process of completing the Financial 
                          Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus course, action plans and financial 
                          goals were created to guide me to an accomplished structure 
                          and a debt-free future. God gave me these blueprints 
                          to guide me in accomplishing this goal. He will free 
                          me from a debt prison to accomplish what He created 
                          me to do. It is no longer my money or all about me, 
                          but it is His money and all about Him. &#8220;It&#8217;s 
                          in Christ that we find out who we are and what we are 
                          living for. Long before we first heard of Christ&#8230; 
                          He had His eye on us, had designs on us for glorious 
                          living, part of the overall purpose He is working out 
                          in everything and everyone.&#8221; Ephesians 1:11 (MSG)</p>
                        <p>I had to build on this foundation and to put the plan 
                          into action. A cash flow control system was the next 
                          step in this process. It is a system that simply keeps 
                          track of God&#8217;s money&#8212;where I spent it, wasted 
                          it, or saved it. Your plan will look great on paper, 
                          but you have to keep track of what monies are actually 
                          coming in and going out. </p>
                        <p>The envelope system is one of the cash flow systems 
                          I chose to use. I simply cash my paycheck monthly and 
                          place the cash into labeled envelopes to use for specific 
                          spending categories. I have an easier time controlling 
                          my spending and tracking my cash flow if the monies 
                          exist in a cash form, in designated category envelopes. 
                          I tend to have more control issues when I use a credit 
                          card or a check card. The envelope system allows me 
                          to envision more effectively how much I have spent or 
                          have left to spend. In turn, I am far less likely to 
                          overspend or to acquire more debt. </p>
                        <p>So, now can you imagine my new church home as a beautiful 
                          sanctuary with a completed structure? Many people will 
                          come to the church to glorify our Father. I want my 
                          financial structure to also be a finished structure 
                          that glorifies our Father. &#8220;For which of you, 
                          intending to build a tower, does not sit down first 
                          and count the cost, and I intend to leave a legacy whether 
                          he has enough to finish it--- lest, after he has laid 
                          the foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see 
                          it begin to mock him, saying, &#8216;This man began 
                          to build and was not able to finish&#8217;.&#8221; Luke 
                          14: 28-30 (NKJ)</p>
