                          <span class="subheaderItalic">The Borrower is Servant  to the Lender</span><br>
                          <span class="bold">By Glen Becker</span><br>
                          <span class="italicRed">Article 1 of 3</span></p>
                        <p>The recent news has been filled  with stories of home foreclosures, bank failures, giant financial firms being  taken over, government bailouts, and credit freezes.&nbsp; The news has also been filled with  accusations of what caused it:&nbsp; greedy  financial institutions, too much government influence in banking, too little  government regulation, too much credit, lies, fraud, and plain old-fashioned  stupidity.&nbsp; This article looks at the  problem from a biblical perspective to get a clear insight into the problem.</p>
                        <p>First the facts:&nbsp; Beginning in 2002, lenders began mortgage  lending to people with very poor credit, and to make home loans that required  little or no up-front money.&nbsp; Partly  because so many people could now buy homes that they previously could not, and  for other reasons, the demand for homes grew very rapidly, which caused prices  to rise rapidly.</p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Speculative Bubble.</span>&nbsp;  If the price of something rises rapidly, people tend to buy it, hoping  to make a profit as the price rises.&nbsp; The  buying pushes up the price, which confirms the prediction of rising prices, so  more people buy.&nbsp; This self-fulfilling  prophecy is called a speculative bubble.&nbsp;  Eventually, when people are no longer willing or able to pay the  ever-higher prices, the bubble pops.&nbsp;  Those who bought in only for profit see falling prices and try to sell  out quickly.&nbsp; The massive sell-off causes  prices to fall much faster than they rose.&nbsp;  This has happened several times in history, beginning with the <strong>Dutch tulip bulb mania</strong> of  1637.&nbsp; There is no question that happened  with housing, because in many places prices continued to increase even as rents  were falling, which proved that the rising prices were not caused by more  people really wanting live in the houses.&nbsp;  The speculative bubble in housing was inflated by greedy buyers, not  just greedy lenders.</p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Political Fallout.&nbsp;</span>  Liberals and conservatives blame each other for the problem.&nbsp; Liberals say that lack of regulation allowed  predatory lending practices, allowing risky loans to be packaged as  mortgage-backed bonds, and the lack of good regulation hid the risks from the  buyers of these supposedly high-grade bonds.</p>
                        <p>Conservatives answer that the  government was to blame.&nbsp; The Affordable  Housing Credit gave <strong>Fannie Mae</strong>  an incentive to buy loans from people with poor credit.&nbsp; Some in Congress pressured Fannie Mae to buy  loans made by people with poor credit, or loans that had lower down payments,  because they wanted more low-income people to become homeowners.&nbsp; Fannie Mae itself began to steer political  contributions toward candidates who agreed with this policy.</p>
                        <p>Others blame the Federal Reserve  for making interest rates too low, thus forcing investors to seek ever riskier  investments to get a decent rate of return.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each side claims that the problem was caused by the political philosophy  of its opponent.</p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Biblical Perspective.</span>&nbsp;  In reality, the problem was caused by massive blindness to Biblical  principles of Finance.&nbsp; The Bible  repeatedly warns of the dangers of debt.&nbsp;  For example, Proverbs 22:7 says "The borrower is servant to the  lender."&nbsp; But in the last decade, the  entire nation behaved as if debt were the secret of perpetual prosperity.&nbsp; After the collapse of the Dot-com bubble in  2001, our continued prosperity was funded mostly by rising home values.&nbsp; The home building and remodeling industries  boomed, creating lots of jobs and income.&nbsp;  Homeowners took out second and third mortgages against the increasing  equity in their homes to buy whatever they wanted.&nbsp; The result was six years of prosperity and  ample employment, all financed by borrowed money.&nbsp; It couldn&rsquo;t last, and it didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Now the whole nation must stop spending and  repay all those debts, and live with the consequences that many will never be  repaid.</p>
                        <p>The Bible has far more to say  about the causes of this financial crisis.&nbsp;  The next article, <a href="financialcrisis02.htm">"Biblical  Perspectives on the Financial Crisis...The Wicked Borrows and Does Not Repay"</a>  goes into more detail.</p>
