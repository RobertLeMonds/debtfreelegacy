                          <span class="bold">by Dianne Becker</span></p>
                        <p>&#8220;Eat, Drink and be Merry for tomorrow you may 
                          die&#8221;&#8212;Epicurus</p>
                        <p>This was the Greek way of thinking and has become an 
                          American lifestyle. As Americans, we are blessed with 
                          so much abundance and easy credit that it makes it easy 
                          to get whatever we want, whenever we want it, without 
                          waiting until we are financially able to afford it. 
                          The problem with this philosophy is that the credit 
                          card bill usually comes in before the money does, leaving 
                          behind unwanted debt. <br>
                          <br>
                          The bible says in Proverbs 21:17 (NIV) &#8220;He who 
                          loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine 
                          and oil will never be rich.&#8221; What this means is 
                          that you must be accountable for your spending and guard 
                          your heart from too much self-indulgence. </p>
                        <p>For example, when you shop, do you plan your trips 
                          with purpose or just shop on impulse? Do you save and 
                          plan for major purchases? Do you live one day at a time 
                          or do you live in view of your future? Do you live within 
                          your means or live outside your comfort zone? </p>
                        <p>Too many impulse purchases can lead to an overload 
                          on credit with the inability to pay debt quickly. Worse 
                          still, you may find yourself paying a much higher interest 
                          rate than you had anticipated. Another downside of using 
                          credit cards is that it is easier to slip those extra 
                          items in the cart. Studies show that credit card spending 
                          results in up to 35% higher purchases, on the average, 
                          compared to shopping and paying cash. </p>
                        <p>Stop, think and look for the best interest rate before 
                          you consider purchasing that new car, boat, or house. 
                          Take time to consider the total cost instead of just 
                          looking at the monthly payments. That can save you money 
                          in the long run. In fact, think very, very hard about 
                          any new debt! Spending money is simple but it often 
                          leads to the slippery slope of debt bondage.</p>
                        <p>Eating out has become a way of life for many who are 
                          too busy, too tired, or too stressed out to cook at 
                          home. Dining out on a regular basis can easily triple 
                          or quadruple your food allowance. </p>
                        <p>So what must you do to avoid the pitfalls of excessive 
                          spending? This calls for a change of heart and a focus 
                          on God&#8217;s goals for your life. The Bible says in 
                          Proverbs 3:5 (NIV) to &#8220;trust in the Lord with 
                          all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.&#8221; 
                          To trust in the Lord means that you must give up your 
                          ways of doing things. Easy credit has opened the door 
                          to easy spending which in turn leads to debt bondage. 
                          It is not God&#8217;s will for you to be in debt. He 
                          has a plan of freedom for all who will trust Him. If 
                          you allow the Lord to make the necessary changes, then 
                          you will be on the pathway to freedom from debt.</p>
                        <p>Find out what God has to say about debt and discover 
                          His freedom plan for you. Financial Freedom in 7 weeks 
                          Plus will answer many of your questions concerning God&#8217;s 
                          plan for your finances. As you learn that all financial 
                          decisions are really spiritual decisions, you&#8217;ll 
                          be well on your way to &#8220;living loud and leaving 
                          a legacy.&#8221;</p>
