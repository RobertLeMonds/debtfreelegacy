                          <span class="bold">by Tracy Young</span></p>
                        <p>&quot;Okay, I get it that God loves me and wants good 
                          things for me, but can I actually pray for my finances?&quot; 
                          &#8220;Is there a place for prayer and spiritual warfare 
                          regarding money?&#8221;</p>
                        <p>&quot;And whatever you ask in My name, that I will 
                          do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If 
                          you ask anything in My name, I will do it.&quot; (John 
                          14:13-14 NKJV) </p>
                        <p>&quot;Yes, but not about finances, right?&quot; </p>
                        <p>&quot;So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to 
                          you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will 
                          be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he 
                          who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will 
                          be opened. &quot;Which of you fathers, if your son asks 
                          for a fish, will give him a snake instead? Or if he 
                          asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, 
                          though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to 
                          your children, how much more will your Father in heaven 
                          give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!&quot; (Luke 
                          11:11-13 NIV) </p>
                        <p>&quot;Yes, that's good and all, but I can never see 
                          myself praying about my finances.&quot; </p>
                        <p>&quot;Yet ye have not, because ye ask not&quot; (James 
                          4:2b KJV) </p>
                        <p>&quot;I don't know if I can have the confidence to 
                          do that.&quot; </p>
                        <p>&quot;This is the confidence we have in approaching 
                          God: that if we ask anything according to his will, 
                          he hears us.&quot; (1 John 5:14 NIV) </p>
                        <p>&quot;What if I ask for something selfish?&quot; </p>
                        <p>&quot;When you ask, you do not receive, because you 
                          ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you 
                          get on your pleasures.&quot; (James 4:3 NIV) </p>
                        <p>&quot;Does God really want to hear my little prayers 
                          about my finances?&quot; </p>
                        <p>&quot;The Lord detests the sacrifice of the wicked,<br>
                          but he delights in the prayers of the upright.&quot; 
                          (Proverbs 15:8 NLT) </p>
                        <p>&quot;Yea, well I am not sure that God will help me.&quot; 
                        </p>
                        <p>&quot;I tell you the truth, you can say to this mountain, 
                          &#8216;May you be lifted up and thrown into the sea,&#8217; 
                          and it will happen. But you must really believe it will 
                          happen and have no doubt in your heart.&quot; (Mark 
                          11:23 NLT) </p>
                        <p>&quot;Well, I do tithe and follow the commands of the 
                          Bible, but I don't know if I am confident that He would 
                          really pay attention to me.&quot; </p>
                        <p>&quot;Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, 
                          we have confidence before God and receive from him anything 
                          we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases 
                          him.&quot; (1 John 3:21-22 NIV) </p>
                        <p>&quot;I am still a little doubtful.&quot; </p>
                        <p>&quot;But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, 
                          because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown 
                          and tossed by the wind.&quot; (James 1:6 NIV) </p>
                        <p>&quot;So, if I pray with confidence, what would He 
                          really do for me?&quot; </p>
                        <p>&quot;Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, 
                          pressed down, shaken together, and running over will 
                          be put into your bosom. For with the same measure that 
                          you use, it will be measured back to you.&quot; (Luke 
                          6:38 NKJV) </p>
                        <p>&quot;So, after I pray, whom should I thank?&quot; 
                        </p>
                        <p>&quot;Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly 
                          above all that we ask or think, according to the power 
                          that works in us, to Him be glory in the church by Christ 
                          Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.&quot; 
                          (Ephesians 3:21-22 NIV) </p>
                        <p>&quot;Thank you. I think I will pray for my finances 
                          and do spiritual warfare against the enemy, as it is 
                          very clear that God wants me to.&quot;</p>
