                          <span class="bold">By Dave Shoemaker</span></p>
                        <p>I started practicing tithing in my family at a time 
                          that our combined income was reduced by 60%, I had no 
                          job lined up, and we moved to a brand new state, bought 
                          a new home, and had invited my mother-in-law to live 
                          with us. I certainly could have used the excuse that 
                          I just can&#8217;t afford to tithe like God instructs 
                          because &#8220;my situation&#8221; certainly justifies 
                          not tithing, and I&#8217;m sure God understands and 
                          is OK with &#8220;my&#8221; decision! I&#8217;ll start 
                          tithing after we make more money! After all that&#8217;s 
                          the answer to all our financial problems anyway, right? 
                          Just make more money, and than we can do all those &#8220;other 
                          things&#8221; WRONG!!</p>
                        <p>Let&#8217;s take a quick look at a few scriptures, 
                          and see what God has to say.</p>
                        <p>1) Why give? 1 Corinthians 10:26 and Psalm 24:1 both 
                          tell us that the whole earth and everything in it is 
                          God&#8217;s. He owns everything, so in reality what 
                          &#8220;I have&#8221; really is God&#8217;s from the 
                          beginning. That includes the money we make. So giving 
                          a tenth (the very first 10%) of all I make to God in 
                          the form of a tithe is really Him allowing us to use 
                          the remaining 90% to live on. What&#8217;s wrong with 
                          that? Malachi 3:8-12 also tells us that if we bring 
                          our tithes into the storehouse (this would mean your 
                          spiritual home where you are being fed and taught God&#8217;s 
                          word (Church)) that God will rebuke the devourer on 
                          our behalf, and open up the windows of heaven and pour 
                          out His blessing upon us. He even says for us to &#8220;test 
                          Him in this&#8221; For me I take God&#8217;s word as 
                          the absolute truth. Again I ask you, why give? It seems 
                          pretty plain to me.</p>
                        <p>2) I can&#8217;t afford to give. Philippians 4:19 says 
                          that my God shall (not maybe) meet all my needs according 
                          to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus. This means we 
                          may not get all &#8220;we&#8221; want, but He is sure 
                          to provide all that we need. Also in Luke 6:38 we are 
                          told; &#8220;Give, and it will be given to you: good 
                          measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running 
                          over will be put into your bosom. For the same measure 
                          that you use, it will be measured back to you.&#8221; 
                        </p>
                        <p>It seems to me that with just these few examples of 
                          scriptures alone, that my personal giving plan should 
                          at the very least include tithing as the minimum requirement, 
                          and then freewill giving over and beyond the tithe, 
                          as the Holy Spirit leads, to spread the gospel (Great 
                          Commission) per Matthew 18:19 &amp; 20, and to help 
                          those less fortunate than myself. The plan should be 
                          a three part giving plan; a) tithing b) freewill offerings 
                          and c) giving to the poor, or sowing alms. When I aligned 
                          my family&#8217;s giving plan, after attending one of 
                          the Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks plus Focus Groups, 
                          to match the three areas mentioned above, God&#8217;s 
                          Word has been manifested in such a way that it can&#8217;t 
                          be explained any other way than simply to say that God 
                          IS faithful with His word, and we have been blessed 
                          beyond what I could ever hope or ask for. </p>
                        <p>Please don&#8217;t allow yourself to be deceived by 
                          the negative thoughts that seem to exist everywhere 
                          we go, and believe what the world may tell you. Immerse 
                          yourself in God&#8217;s Word and live according to His 
                          good plan and desires for your life. God is just waiting 
                          to pour out His blessings on you (Jeremiah 29:11 &amp; 
                          Malachi 3:10-12).</p>
