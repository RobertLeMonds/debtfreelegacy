                          <span class="bold">By Glen Becker</span><br>
                          <span class="italicRed">Article 2 of 3</span></p>
                        <p>The first article,<a href="financialcrisis.htm"> "What Caused  the Financial Crisis&hellip;.The Borrower is Servant to the Lender"</a>, explored the poor  decisions and finger-pointing about the causes of the current financial  difficulties.&nbsp; This article explores what  the Bible says about the foolish decisions that led us into this financial  mess.</p>
                        <p>The Bible admonished Christians  to honor their commitments.&nbsp; Proverbs  22:1 says "A good name is more desirable than great riches," and Psalm 37:21  says "the wicked borrow and do not repay."&nbsp;  Yet many home buyers cared nothing about repaying their debts.&nbsp; They put no money down on their houses,  hoping to sell at a profit, but otherwise it would be the bank&rsquo;s loss.&nbsp; Now that the value of their houses has  declined, many homeowners with solid incomes and good credit are simply walking  away from their loans, even though they could repay.&nbsp; This is not a financial problem, but rather  it is a spiritual problem.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, many people took out <strong>stated income loans</strong>, sometimes  called "liar loans," in which the borrower states his income with the  understanding that it would never be verified.&nbsp;  I asked a loan processor who had repented of her involvement in <strong>sub-prime</strong> lending, whether some  of the people who got these loans lied about their income.&nbsp; She said, "No, ALL  of them did."&nbsp; Her co-workers called them  "NINJA" loans, for "NO Income, No Job or Assets."&nbsp; Any form of deception violates God&rsquo;s  standards.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fannie Mae</strong> was created by the U.S. Government to make money  available to finance homes by buying mortgages and funding the purchases with  bonds.&nbsp; It was a stock company,  controlled by its shareholders like any other corporation, but with a dual  purpose:&nbsp; to encourage increased home  ownership, and to make a profit for its shareholders.&nbsp; Fannie Mae, therefore, had two different  masters with two very different objectives.</p>
                        <p>Matthew 6:24 says "No one can serve two masters."&nbsp; Yet Fannie Mae allowed itself to be pressured  by some in Congress to buy lower quality, riskier mortgages, and tried to  protect its owners by carefully mixing risky mortgages with good ones.&nbsp; By trying to serve two masters it utterly  failed both:&nbsp; its owners lost their  entire investments, and the Federal Government was forced to take over Fannie  Mae and become responsible for its bad debts.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>The Bible warns us that doing the  right thing sometimes requires courage.&nbsp;  Those who blame congressional pressure for the bad loans ignore the fact  that Congress never forced anyone to make or buy bad loans.&nbsp; Doing so would have required new legislation,  which would have caused a public debate over the issue.&nbsp; Such a debate would have revealed the  problem, and may have stopped it.&nbsp; As it  was, Fannie Mae and others quietly bowed to the pressure and hid the  risks.&nbsp; The Bible calls such cowardice  "wickedness":&nbsp; Revelation 21:8 lists "the  cowardly" along with "the unbelievers, the vile, the murderers," etc., as those  whose "place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur."</p>
                        <p>Now we have seen almost  unprecedented financial collapse, desperate attempts to get credit flowing  again.&nbsp; The Federal Government has pumped  hundreds of billions of dollars into the banking system to try to encourage  banks to lend, hoping this money will pump the economy back up.&nbsp; Yet many people and institutions that have  money to lend are so scared that they are only willing to make absolutely safe  investments.&nbsp; They recently bid  short-term U.S. Treasury Notes so high that their yield was literally zero.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the reason for this  crisis of confidence is the Biblical law of sowing and reaping.&nbsp; Millions of Americans proved by their actions  that their word is meaningless, that their motives are purely selfish, and that  they cannot be trusted. &nbsp;The banks got  the message.&nbsp; They are willing to lend,  but only to those whose behavior shows that they care about their word, that  they borrow only when it is wise to do so, and that their desire to keep their  promises is motivated by more than just the hope of being able to borrow  again.&nbsp; Those who cannot borrow are now  being forced to do what they should  have been doing all along:&nbsp; to balance  income and spending, to plan, and to be careful to meet their obligations on  time.&nbsp; Those who lost their jobs must now  rely on God instead of themselves for their security.</p>
                        <p>The next article, <a href="financialcrisis03.htm">"How to Fix the  Financial Crisis...Using God&rsquo;s Wisdom,"</a> will explore God&rsquo;s perspective on how to  correct the problems.</p>
