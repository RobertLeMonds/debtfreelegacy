                          <span class="bold">By Amber Drabek</span></p>
                        <p>In the Sitter&#8217;s book: Financial Freedom in 7 
                          Weeks Plus, prosperity is defined as having enough resources 
                          (money, time, talent, and health) to accomplish everything 
                          God has called us to do. If God is in the center of 
                          our finances, then they will flourish and grow. &#8220;Through 
                          skillful and Godly wisdom is a house (a life, a home, 
                          a family) built, and by understanding it is established 
                          (on a sound and good foundation). And by knowledge shall 
                          its chambers (of every area) be filled with all precious 
                          and pleasant riches.&#8221; Proverbs 24:3-4 (AMP)</p>
                        <p>Saving money regularly is an integral key to remaining 
                          prosperous. God blesses us with the resources that we 
                          need, but we must remain effective stewards of these 
                          resources. We can learn a great deal from the ant. &#8220;Go 
                          to the ant you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise! 
                          It has no commander, no overseer, or ruler, yet it stores 
                          its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest.&#8221; 
                          Proverbs 6:6-8 (NIV) The ant is a small and fragile 
                          creature with not much power individually. However, 
                          with its diligence and dedication to an ant hill, the 
                          storing of its provisions gets completed in an amazing 
                          way. We must remain powerfully connected to God&#8217;s 
                          guidance and follow His direction to store up (save) 
                          provisions, for the future. Retirement savings makes 
                          great sense and this allows us to be in a powerful and 
                          amazing position to financially do whatever He calls 
                          us to do. </p>
                        <p>Saving money without God&#8217;s guidance or direction 
                          will lead us to simply hoarding money. Then money becomes 
                          our focus, instead of God and His plans for how we are 
                          to steward His money. &#8220;Keep your lives free from 
                          the love of money and be content with what you have, 
                          because God has said, never will I leave you; never 
                          will I forsake you.&#8221; Hebrews 13:5 (NIV) He wants 
                          us to plan for the future and to be able to provide 
                          for ourselves, our families, or for others. Saving, 
                          along with biblical giving, is part of God&#8217;s plan 
                          of preparation for a future that He has already planned 
                          for us. Therefore, saving money should never be an act 
                          that involves worrying about tomorrow. Remember, the 
                          Lord said that He would never leave us nor forsake us. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Retirement planning is another issue related to savings, 
                          and it definitely better prepares you and your family 
                          for the future. We must include preparations for uncertainties 
                          and for all new endeavors that may show-up as we consider 
                          retirement. The Lord wants us to be ready and willing 
                          to complete whatever endeavor He holds for us at this 
                          season of life. It may be a spiritual call or a second 
                          secular career (see the book Game Plan) but God certainly 
                          does not want His people, regardless of age, to just 
                          retire and watch TV.</p>
                        <p>What a day to look forward to, when the Lord says,&#8221; 
                          Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been 
                          faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge 
                          of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!&#8221; 
                          Matthew 25:23 (NIV).</p>
