                        <p>When we stop and think about it, God owns everything 
                          in the natural world and we are merely stewards or managers 
                          of what He has entrusted us to take care of. (Ps.24:1, 
                          Deut. 8:18). God makes it clear that everything we manage 
                          for Him comes from Him. As good stewards, God expects 
                          us to wisely manage the three sources that He gives 
                          all of us: our Time, Talent, and Treasure.</p>
                        <p>In Mal.3: 8-12, God instructs us to give back to Him 
                          a tenth of what he has given to us. This is the basic 
                          amount He asks of us. The Lord also wants us to give 
                          freewill offerings to advance His Kingdom and alms (charity) 
                          to the poor. </p>
                        <p>Our tithe is not derived from our net income, after 
                          taxes, but from our gross income before taxes! Many 
                          people are unaware of this biblical truth. For example, 
                          before my husband and I learned this principle, the 
                          enemy was vexing us in the area of our finances. By 
                          failing to give God the entire tithe, we put ourselves 
                          under a curse. (Mal.3: 8-9). After learning this principle, 
                          we corrected this misconception and our finances began 
                          to get into line with God&#8217;s Word so that we were 
                          then able to hear how God wanted us to allocate His 
                          money. Within one short year, we were on our way to 
                          becoming completely debt free, except for our home mortgage&#8230;and 
                          we hope that soon follows.</p>
                        <p>Once we understand that the true tithe is what the 
                          Bible calls a first fruits obligation, and that it is 
                          10% of our gross income, we see that as God increases 
                          our income we should be cheerful about paying a larger 
                          tithe in proportion to our income. Offerings and alms 
                          are the second and third components of a three part 
                          biblical giving plan. These are based on freewill decisions 
                          that should be prayerfully made. We certainly encourage 
                          you to increase freewill giving as God blesses you with 
                          more income.</p>
                        <p>Is the concept of giving on your &#8220;gross income&#8221; 
                          new to you? Is your response &#8220;I can&#8217;t afford 
                          to give that much&#8221;? As things appear right now, 
                          this may appear to be true, however according to Mal. 
                          3:10-12, you will find that this is the only place in 
                          the bible that the Lord gives us the challenge to test 
                          Him. By being obedient and putting God in the middle 
                          of your finances, you give Him your permission to break 
                          the power of the enemy over your finances and that positions 
                          you to enter into the abundance of His blessings! (Jer.29:11) 
                          I&#8217;m sure glad that we did!</p>
