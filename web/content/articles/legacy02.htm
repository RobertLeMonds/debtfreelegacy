                          <span class="bold">by Jason Cobb</span></p>
                        <p>In 2003 take your finances to a new level, Bill and 
                          Maureen Sitter deliver a balanced and biblical approach 
                          to debt free living. This past month I interviewed the 
                          authors of the tremendous resource, Bill and Maureen 
                          shared with me the history, ministry and impact of their 
                          course Financial Freedom In 7 Weeks Plus. Debt free 
                          living is possible. SAWorship.com considers it a privilege

                          the resource: Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus, below 
                          is the interview that took place at SAWorship.com headquarters 
                          in San Antonio. </p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Question:</span> <span class="boldRed">Bill, 
                          give our audience some background on how you and Maureen 
                          got started with financial counseling and training, 
                          and what led you to publish your book: Financial Freedom 
                          in 7 Weeks Plus.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Bill:</span> Over ten years ago, 
                          I was invited to be a co-leader along with an Elder 
                          Wayne Gordon at Eagle's Nest Christian Fellowship. We 
                          started teaching using some Christian finance materials 
                          that were available. We did some counseling through 
                          the church that really gave me a chance to plug into 
                          the area of need in the body of Christ that's exciting 
                          to me - helping people get freedom in the area of finances 
                          and get out of debt bondage. The more I studied, and 
                          the more we taught and counseled, the more this excited 
                          us. We started using fairly large classes at the church, 
                          conducting those two to three times a year, but that 
                          really wasn't producing the fruit that we wanted to 
                          see. We observed people getting excited about the classes, 
                          but we weren't seeing lasting changes in their life. 
                          So we realized that some kind of a small group program 
                          was needed, to really drive the ideas home to people 
                          who had a real need and serious interest in changing. 
                          The number of things that came together in God's plan 
                          was amazing. First, I had an opportunity to help another 
                          global ministry start writing a finance program. Then 
                          Maureen and I were finally released to write the complete 
                          book, on our own, and that was very exciting and humbling. 
                          The book, Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus is a product 
                          of work that Maureen and I have done together over a 
                          period of about five years, to produce a stand alone 
                          text book, workbook, and leader's guide, all in one. 
                          Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus can be used by a church 
                          and we feel the course works best in a small group environment. 
                        </p>
                        <p>This book can be used by individuals or couples, on 
                          their own. However, ideally it's used in a small group 
                          program, under the covering of a local church. We are 
                          not trying to create a separate ministry; this book 
                          is provided as a resource to local churches. The local 
                          church raises up their own leaders and they use the 
                          material in the book as a teaching guide and a small 
                          &quot;focus group&quot; workbook. They have everything 
                          they need. No other resource is required, and the book 
                          provides instructions on how to train their own leaders. 
                          That's the evolution, and we published around Christmas 
                          time, in 2002. We are now, as self-publishers, really 
                          getting this material out so that churches and other 
                          ministries can learn about it. The good news is that 
                          we have been using and refining the material in one 
                          form or another for over five years. We have a lot of 
                          testimonies, in the book and on the web site, that we 
                          know will excite people, because these are people who 
                          have been through this material and have had very good 
                          results.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Question:</span><span class="boldRed"> 
                          What is different about this book, and the 7-week course, 
                          as compared to other resources available?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Maureen:</span> We use spiritual 
                          warfare. We do not know of others who use it, or use 
                          it as much. We identify the devil as the thief, per 
                          John 10:10, and we go after him as you'd go after any 
                          robber.</p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Bill:</span> We really are trying 
                          to put Christians in position to do battle; in other 
                          words this is a fight, a fight to get it right in each 
                          area of our lives. The good news is God gave us a manual 
                          on how to do that, The Bible, and it didn't stop being 
                          effective 2000 years ago, it's relevant for today. As 
                          Maureen said, we want people to understand that you 
                          start by recognizing that everything we have came from 
                          God. God owns it all! Deuteronomy 8:18 tells us that 
                          God is the one who gives us our abilities, skills, and 
                          gifts, everything came from Him. We have to recognize, 
                          if we are a wonderful superstar athlete or if we are 
                          a blue-collar worker at a factory, that whatever skills 
                          we have, to do what we are doing, come from God. If 
                          we recognize that, then that's good. We start each of 
                          the 7 weekly focus group sessions by praising God and 
                          doing battle against Satan, that's one of the big distinctions. 
                          The other is that we teach that tithing is just the 
                          start of the giving plan not the end of it. We want 
                          people to have a heart for God so that as they read 
                          through the Psalms, Proverbs, Hebrews or many of books 
                          of the Bible, they'll see reinforcement for giving offerings 
                          and alms beyond the tithe. </p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Maureen: </span>We usually give 
                          focus group members a large play dollar bill that has 
                          a heart on it, then another one with the word God in 
                          the heart. This encourages people to examine their own 
                          hearts to see whether God or money is first in our hearts. 
                          The whole point is that God wants our hearts, so it's 
                          all about the attitude of the heart. He has to do the 
                          heart surgery, we can teach it but God has to do the 
                          work, and He does it well. It is not effective to counsel 
                          or train one half of a married couple, it just doesn't 
                          bear much fruit. It's great that at least one person 
                          from the marriage wants to get it right; but in terms 
                          of finance, and other major decisions, God talks about 
                          one flesh. We have to come together as a married couple, 
                          if we are not in agreement in the area of finances, 
                          it's not going to work. In the book and in the weekly 
                          homework assignments, we ask married couples to do the 
                          homework together. For individuals they should get an 
                          accountability partner to help them; it works better 
                          and this can be a friend or family member.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Question:</span> <span class="boldRed">How 
                          would a church or ministry organize a 7-week focus group? 
                          And, is there a set of instructions for churches to 
                          use&#8230;leader's guide&#8230;forms?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Bill: </span>The book is written 
                          so an individual can use it, anybody can pick it up. 
                          A couple that does not have access to a church, maybe 
                          they are living in a remote area, they can use this 
                          program and they can get good results. It was designed 
                          this way. It's really most effective when used in a 
                          church or a ministry where they actually adopt this 
                          as a workbook for small groups. Essentially the church 
                          community develops their own leaders and assistant leaders; 
                          we use the term Leaders In Training. We have leaders 
                          training other leaders under the local church's covering, 
                          training people who want to be in a small group environment. 
                          Probably 14 to 15 people in a group is a nice group 
                          size, and it might meet at a home, which we prefer, 
                          or you could have it a church or other remote location, 
                          as long as it's private. The leaders are committed to 
                          leading the group for seven consecutive weeks with weekly 
                          homework and they present the 7 weekly group teachings 
                          from Chapters 1-7.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the seven-week course, there is an accountability 
                          session. We ask people to complete this follow up session 
                          within 45 days after completing the course. They meet 
                          individually with their leaders to review their progress 
                          and review their spending plan forms. A church can initiate 
                          this program by contacting us. We would like them to 
                          know as much as they can about the course, or look at 
                          our web site. For out of town people, call us at our 
                          toll free number 1-800-392-9410. If you are within the 
                          City of San Antonio, you can call us at 210-651-5561. 
                          We'd love to talk to pastors, adult education leaders, 
                          or small group coordinators to help you get started 
                          with this program in your area. We do this as a ministry; 
                          this is not a business, and we feel that God has called 
                          us to this. We want to help spread this material around. 
                          We want the local church to be the one in control, I 
                          believe pastors really need to know that. </p>
                        <p>We suggest that offerings be taken during the weekly 
                          group sessions, the offerings should go wherever the 
                          local church decides. The offering doesn't come to us. 
                          How that all works is explained in the leader's section 
                          of the book to include report forms, etc.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Question:</span> <span class="boldRed">Bill, 
                          your book contrasts the world's view of &quot;prosperity&quot; 
                          with God's view?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Bill:</span> We start with the 
                          understanding of what prosperity really is. I think 
                          there has been a lot of confusion on the subject of 
                          prosperity. A lot of people thought that if you wanted 
                          some lavish gift, say a luxury car, or a bigger house 
                          then all you had to do was &quot;name it, and claim 
                          it&quot; in the name of Jesus. Not that these possessions 
                          are bad, but God is not into lavishing us, just so we 
                          can be lavished. We define prosperity the way I think 
                          God views it. &quot;Prosperity is having all the resources, 
                          the talent, ability, skills, relationships, and money 
                          we need to do everything God has called us to do.&quot; 
                          That's the key, what God has called us to do, not what 
                          we want to do, not what we feel like doing, not what 
                          our neighbor is doing. But what God has called us to 
                          do; for some people that's raising a family and providing 
                          for them in a godly way, for other people it may be 
                          missions, for other people it may be a career in business, 
                          music or sports. We have the right to believe that He 
                          will provide the resources we need. As long as we focus 
                          on what God has called us to do, we are bound to stay 
                          in balance. We must not get into greed nor should we 
                          have a poverty mentality. The Bible is full of verses, 
                          probably well over 2000 verses, that deal with money 
                          in some way, to include giving, debt, and stewardship. 
                          God obviously felt, in the Old and New Testament, that 
                          teaching on finances is relevant for today. We start 
                          with this enlightened understanding of prosperity, then 
                          we plug-in God's principles on tithing, and giving, 
                          debt repayment, planning and what we call the Spending 
                          Plan. All of these concepts are reinforced through the 
                          Word of God so we can stay in balance. </p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Question:</span> <span class="boldRed">Explain 
                          the flexible &quot;spending plan&quot; concept and how 
                          it differs from a &quot;budget&quot;.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Maureen: </span>People learn 
                          to make decisions on how they spend their money. Instead 
                          of having a budget, the spending plan is not something 
                          that's constricting them, but it is something that is 
                          freeing them up. They record their debts and bills and 
                          they project their family's needs. They decide how they 
                          want to allocate their money. They are free to move 
                          funds around, from category to category, it's flexible 
                          and they are in control.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Bill: </span>We have a lot of fun 
                          in our half day seminars and with focus groups, because 
                          Maureen will beep me with a little noisemaker if I use 
                          the word &quot;budget&quot;. We do not teach the word 
                          budget, because the word budget sounds like a diet, 
                          something that is imposed by other people. You get the 
                          feeling that if you cross the line, that you have blown 
                          the budget and you feel doomed. The whole concept of 
                          the flexible-spending plan, is that individuals or couples 
                          work through the workbook and build a complete financial 
                          plan for their family. These are all simple forms, there 
                          is no advanced math or college education required, no 
                          knowledge of computers, and you can do this all with 
                          a pencil. You learn how to record your debts, your assets, 
                          your liabilities; how to prepare a simple balance sheet 
                          and a net worth statement. Most couples, at first, think 
                          they could never prepare a balance sheet and net worth 
                          statement. </p>
                        <p>We also teach them how to develop a debt repayment 
                          plan and how to analyze their expenses on a monthly 
                          basis. I left out one key form, at the very beginning, 
                          the Income and Biblical Giving form people record how 
                          much they make, and how much they plan to give, then 
                          we go from there. That's the first piece of the eight 
                          forms in the basic spending plan. Finally, in week 7, 
                          there are monthly cash flow forms. All these forms feed 
                          one to the next, to the next. In the monthly cash flow 
                          analysis they actually see whether they have money left 
                          at the end of the month or month left at the end of 
                          the money. We teach how to go back and rework plans 
                          as a couple or as individuals or single parents with 
                          kids. As Maureen said, the plan is flexible and it's 
                          okay to move some money from one category to another. 
                          This all comes together to make what we call the flexible 
                          spending plan. The couple or individual or family is 
                          in control. </p>
                        <p>God expects from us what He expects from a business, 
                          for us to be in control and to look at all aspects of 
                          our business as good stewards. I believe God expects 
                          Bill and Maureen to be accountable just like a small 
                          company; we use the term Bill and Maureen, Inc. There 
                          is a mythical couple in the book, Bob and Mary Jones. 
                          We use two examples to show how Bob and Mary were doing 
                          things wrong and, in a year or so later, how they did 
                          things right, after getting wisdom from the course. 
                          This program gives people hope and easy examples to 
                          follow. We want to make the course really simple, if 
                          people say they forgot or that they had to miss a class, 
                          the information is in the book. It's similar in a way 
                          to the Bible, if you read the instructions the right 
                          answers will always come out. We know it works now because 
                          we have been testing this for five years, and we have 
                          observed a lot of excellent results. </p>
                        <p>The final chapter, that we added to make it a 7-week 
                          course, is called Keeping Track of God's Money; and 
                          this is an important chapter. We found out that, on 
                          paper, people sometimes estimated they were in good 
                          financial shape, but in fact, at the end of the month, 
                          they were in bad shape. The numbers in the monthly cash 
                          flow box may indicated that they should have money left, 
                          but it was not there. A lot of businesses have been 
                          in that same predicament. If people don't have the money 
                          they thought they should have, then where is it? The 
                          final or revised plan ends up being accurate because 
                          group members learn to readjust the plan and go forward. 
                          This is not something that you do once in life and never 
                          do it again. No, it is a life process.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Question:</span> <span class="boldRed">Can 
                          you comment on successes from this training? (Any testimonials)?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Bill: </span>We try to make the 
                          seminar and our course fun; (the seminar is only a half 
                          a day). The devil is trying to keep people in doom and 
                          gloom. God has a good plan. People should get excited, 
                          even at the early stage, when they face-up to their 
                          debts and other obstacles, because they are starting 
                          on the road to Financial Freedom. They are going to 
                          get free if they stick with it. </p>
                        <p>Maureen came up with the &quot;Breakthrough&quot; form. 
                          The first part of each weekly homework assignment is 
                          to report on breakthroughs. Every week leaders hear 
                          of pay raises, interest rates being cut, supernatural 
                          increase, and so forth. That's why the first four pages 
                          of the book are full of testimonies, and those are repeated 
                          on our web site. We know there are going to be a lot 
                          more new testimonies as more people are taking the course 
                          right now. It's fun for us to see those testimonies 
                          when people take the time to tell us how this course 
                          has changed their lives. We are not surprised anymore 
                          because we know God's Word is true. </p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Maureen:</span> God changes hearts, 
                          for example a husband in Houston, who was attending 
                          a focus group, came to the group and gave his wife a 
                          little jar with his credit cards all cut up. It was 
                          a classic breakthrough example. Previously he had his 
                          money and she had her money, they had separate checkbooks. 
                          The husband was a big spender, but in Week 5 he gave 
                          her his checkbook and this was a huge breakthrough. 
                          Now both have cut up the credit cards and there is one 
                          family checkbook.</p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Bill:</span> This man's wife 
                          was visibly shaken; it was the first time in their whole-married 
                          life that they agreed to put everything together. That 
                          was so exciting to us because we knew then they were 
                          on the road to success. </p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Maureen:</span> He asked her 
                          to write a check for the offering that night, she was 
                          physically shaking with excitement.</p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Bill:</span> She had a hard time 
                          writing the check, before there was his checkbook and 
                          her checkbook, now it was their checkbook. </p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Maureen:</span> You could just 
                          see the changes. </p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Bill:</span> We don't have to 
                          have the testimonials to know that this works. But they 
                          sure do help, and they encourage people. When we do 
                          a seminar, we like to have recent course grads come 
                          to the seminar and present their testimony, and explain 
                          how the changes have impacted their family. This means 
                          a lot, it's one thing to have participated in the teaching, 
                          but it's another thing to have reinforcement from people, 
                          who are just like you and me, who have experienced success. 
                          We have one couple on the Southside of San Antonio who 
                          are now group leaders. They started with really no knowledge 
                          of finances, they admitted that openly. They now have 
                          taught several courses, and presented seminars, using 
                          our material in other churches, locally and in Austin. 
                          They have a wonderful testimony; they are on track not 
                          only to be debt free, but to do a whole lot more. </p>
                        <p>In the 7 week course we actually lead people through 
                          two different planning and goal setting exercises, so 
                          they can align their goals, their values, and their 
                          plans. We then get more specific and have them put a 
                          five-year plan together, so they realize that financial 
                          freedom does not happen overnight, it is a process. 
                          It is okay to plan for your future; God gives us encouragement 
                          and instruction to plan, that's rolled into this course 
                          as well. Everything taught in this course is backed 
                          up with scripture.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Question:</span> <span class="boldRed">Your 
                          web site is www.debtfreelegacy.com. What's the significance 
                          of the name?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Bill:</span> As we were working 
                          on the course we were working with another ministry 
                          involved in marriages. One of the things we sensed strongly 
                          was that it is great to help somebody become debt free. 
                          The greatest reward is to see God blessing something, 
                          that you had a hand in doing for Him, helping his people 
                          become debt free. The real key is that God is a generational 
                          God and if this course is just for us today, then that's 
                          one thing. It's like salvation, if salvation is just 
                          for us then that's fine, but it isn't really God's plan. 
                          He wants our kids, our grandkids, our friends, and our 
                          parents to catch this Vision of a debt free legacy. 
                          We feel that www.debtfreelegacy.com is a great way to 
                          say that all this isn't just about us, it's about getting 
                          this right so we can train, teach and model this to 
                          other people. Even if people are not yet comfortable 
                          receiving the salvation message, they can see the reward 
                          of a successful life, a godly life, even if they do 
                          not understand it. If the world keeps seeing Christians 
                          experience true success, a good attitude, contentment, 
                          and being a good employee, a good boss, or a cheerful 
                          giver, then people will want to know more. They'll ask, 
                          what are you doing and how can I get that? We all admire 
                          those things even if we don't want to admit it. The 
                          very actions that we take, to change from an incorrect 
                          legacy to a godly legacy, are going to pass on a bright 
                          future to future generations. You can have an impact 
                          on hundred's of people over your lifetime with out ever 
                          knowing it, that is why our web site is called www.debtfreelegacy.com.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Question:</span> <span class="boldRed">What 
                          encouragement and hope can you give the readers of SAWorship.com?</span></p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Maureen:</span> If people will 
                          take responsibility and commit to taking this course, 
                          to reading the book, and will apply what it instructs, 
                          along with following the Lord, then they should get 
                          out of debt. </p>
                        <p><span class="boldRed">Bill:</span> God wants every 
                          person to have a blueprint for accomplishing what God 
                          has called them to do. We are trying to take God's Word, 
                          put it into real simple 2003 terminology; this will 
                          help the biblical principles come alive everyday. Whether 
                          they want to use our book or use some other Godly source, 
                          we want them to get a grip on the fact that part of 
                          being a good Christian, a good person, good father or 
                          mother, or family member is financial stewardship. It 
                          is important to learn how to take care of God's money, 
                          and to forget the term &quot;my money&quot;, this term 
                          does not exist because we are called to be stewards 
                          of His resources. Psalm 50:10 makes it clear that God 
                          owns everything. We're like the branch manager of a 
                          bank, who does not own the bank but who stewards the 
                          banks resources for the board of directors and the stockholders. 
                          God wants us to be good branch managers. It's not hard, 
                          the hardest part is deciding to make the change and 
                          letting God be at the center of our hearts. </p>
                        <p>Be encouraged, becoming debt free is not unrealistic. 
                          With the wisdom and power of God and a willingness to 
                          change one's spending habits, becoming debt free can 
                          be a reality. If you are struggling in the area of finances, 
                          or you find yourself or family in a self-made financial 
                          mess; I would recommend looking further into this course. 
                          Consider bringing this course to your church. As a graduate 
                          of this course, God can change your situation. Be willing 
                          to renew your mind and act in obedience to God and His 
                          word.</p>
