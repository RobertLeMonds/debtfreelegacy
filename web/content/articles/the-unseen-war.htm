<hr> <p><span class="articleTitle">The Unseen War</span><br>
  <span class="bold">By Jerry Lintz</span>, Graduate of &quot;Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus&quot; course </p>
<p>My name is Jerry Lintz. For those of you who  don&rsquo;t know me, I am a <a href="http://www.debtfreelegacy.com">www.debtfreelegacy.com</a> team member and graduate of the 7 week small group program. During the course,  I found the most enlightening aspect of &ldquo;7 weeks +&rdquo; to be the extent to which  the spirit world not only affects our financial situation, but also influences  all aspects of our daily existence. And, since Bill Sitter and I have been  searching for my role as a fellow servant in this wonderful ministry, I have  decided to begin a series of articles on <em>spiritual  warfare</em>.</p>
<p>For those of you who may be new to the concept  of spiritual warfare, let me make something abundantly clear&hellip;IF YOU ARE NOT  ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN BATTLING AGAINST THE POWERS OF DARKNESS, THEN YOU ARE  LOSING A VERY IMPORTANT WAR!!!</p>
<p>Let  there be no mistake. There IS a battle going on around us. We may not be able  to see, smell, or touch it, but rest assured it is occurring even as you read  this. And this fight is not only between God Almighty and the god of this world  (Satan). Oh no, this battle involves each and every one of us: both those that  are lost; and especially, those of us who belong to Christ.</p>
<p>How  can I be so sure of this you ask? Well, the Bible is our primary source of  intelligence information, or &ldquo;intel&rdquo; where Paul tells us in <u>Eph_6:12</u>:  &ldquo;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,  against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against  spiritual wickedness in high <em>places.&rdquo;</em> (KJV) Notice, Paul does not say we <em>might</em>, or we <em>may</em> wrestle. Also, please note Paul doesn&rsquo;t say we<em> will</em> wrestle, or even we <em>have </em>wrestled. Paul&rsquo;s phraseology erases  any doubt concerning the nature and scope of this WARFARE. It is ongoing, it is  personal, it occurs in the spiritual realm, and if you belong to Christ, it is  aimed directly at YOU!!! So please don&rsquo;t be deceived into thinking that just  because you&rsquo;re not actively engaged in ministry, or that because you&rsquo;re saved  the battle is over for you. Now, I believe that if we are going to be in a war,  we should learn as much as we can about this war, train our hearts and minds to  function in the face of fear, and equip ourselves to the extent possible in  order to be the warriors our Captain and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ desires  us to be.</p>
<p>Therefore,  in future articles, it is my intent to use the Bible to first educate you about  the identity, nature, and tactics of our enemy. Then, I plan to show how we can  train our hearts and minds to recognize and counteract the &ldquo;wiles of the  enemy&rdquo;. Finally, I will show how we can start each day by equipping ourselves  with the whole &ldquo;armor of God&rdquo; and then &ldquo;gird our loins&rdquo; for battle so that we  are constantly prepared for the attacks that will undoubtedly assail us as we  go about our everyday lives.</p>
<p>So  please join me next week as we learn about our enemies and prepare for battle  in a war we cannot afford to lose. (If you&rsquo;d like a hint as to our primary  enemies&rsquo; identity, please see I Peter 5:8). In the meantime please use this  prayer form the pages of &ldquo;7 weeks +&rdquo; to begin preparing for victory:</p>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;In the mighty Name of Jesus Christ, and in  accordance with God&rsquo;s Word, we take authority over Satan and all his demonic  forces that try to come against us. We are God&rsquo;s children, protected by the  blood of Jesus, and we declare that you &ndash; devil &ndash; were defeated at the cross  and at the grave of Jesus and you remain defeated. Your weapons will not succeed  or prosper. So we command you to take your hands off in Jesus&rsquo; Mighty name! And  all God&rsquo;s people said&hellip;Amen!&rdquo;
