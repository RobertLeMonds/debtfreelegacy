                          to help smash the bondage of debt and empower people 
                          with abundance and a spirit of generosity. Plain and 
                          simple - it works! It has worked in our church and it 
                          will work in yours.</p>
                        <p>Bill and Maureen Sitter are faithful members of this 
                          ministry and people of proven character. They are a 
                          precious resource to our church, having liberated hundreds 
                          of people from crushing debt into generous givers. I 
                          urge you to get this book and I urge you to contact 
                          Bill and Maureen to come to your church - you won't

                          Freedom in 7 weeks Plus is like sitting at the feet 
                          of Bill and Maureen Sitter. We would direct you to Proverbs 
                          that would exhort you to heed their words of (financial) 
                          wisdom which will lead you to the understanding of the 
                          Lord&#8217;s principles of prosperity. Their wisdom 
                          comes from studying the Word and applying it in their 
                          life with great success. Their heart for the Lord&#8217;s 
                          prosperity, along with a heart of giving, has given 
                          them a personal goal of giving from their abundance 
                          $1,000,000 into the Kingdom in their lifetime. Their 
                          heart for you who want to sit at their feet is what 
                          at you will learn the &#8220;ways of the Lord&#8221; 
                          and grow abundantly in the Lord&#8217;s prosperity. 
                          They believe that those who will learn from them will 
                          personally prosper so much that they (and you) will 
                          give $1,000,000,000 into the advancement of the Kingdom 
                          of the Lord. There is no better place to learn.&#8221;

                        <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known Bill and Maureen for over twenty 
                          years. They are a rock-solid couple &#8211; pursuing 
                          excellence in every part of their lives. Financial Freedom 
                          in 7 Weeks Plus is a down-to-earth, workable program 
                          designed to liberate families from financial bondage. 
                          With this new freedom, a family can rise above the fray, 
                          catch a bigger vision for their lives, and begin pursuing 
                          the noble cause that God is calling them to. The book 
                          breaks the bondage then releases a family toward victorious 
                          living.&#8221;</p>

                        <p>&#8220;As an executive in a large retail company employing 
                          thousands of people I have witnessed firsthand the devastation 
                          caused by uncontrolled debt in the lives of our employees. 
                          Being overwhelmed by debt is a major cause of marital 
                          stress. It also has a significant impact on employee 
                          productivity. Miracles happens in marriages and jobs 
                          when this debt is eliminated for good. Financial Freedom 
                          in 7 Weeks Plus has been the generator of these types 
                          of miracles. I strongly recommend this course.&#8221;

                          have watched as their vision took shape and became their 
                          first edition and now their second edition. We are in 
                          complete agreement that to advance the Kingdom people 
                          must be set debt free and to know God&#8217;s Word concerning 
                          finances. We have seen people set free from debt bondage

                          it to everyone and every church.&#8221;</p>

                        <p>&#8220;Bill and Maureen Sitter have prepared a thoughtful, 
                          Scriptural, and thoroughly practical book entitled Financial 
                          Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus. Hundreds of people have already 
                          read and applied the principles. Their testimonies are 
                          the best possible endorsement of this material.</p>
                        <p>I would add this promise: if you examine the main points 
                          and prayerfully apply them, your finances will be blessed 
                          and you will experience freedom from oppression, confusion, 
                          and debt. Beyond that, their seven-week focus groups 
                          offer a hands-on opportunity to move from theory to 
                          life-giving experiences. It&#8217;s more than a book 
                          and a follow-up class. It actually is an invitation 
                          to a life of financial freedom.&#8221; </p>

                          Congregation these past few years. It has proven to 
                          be a great blessing both to the participants and the 
                          congregation. Teaching about stewardship and tithing 
                          is sometimes difficult but the format makes it practical 
                          and easier for the congregation to comprehend and practice.&#8221;</p>

                          thank you both for a successful Financial Freedom course. 
                          We would first like to express our gratitude for your 
                          vision of financial freedom from debt bondage that you 
                          both have taken and shared with so many. Your close 
                          relationship with the Father sprang forth a vision that 
                          is now multiplying in fruition. Thank you for our focus 
                          group leaders and leaders in training who taught by 
                          example. Seeing them already living debt free, allowed 
                          us both to see this life was possible. We enjoyed their 
                          breakthroughs and their determination to see us succeed. 
                          It means the world when people are behind you, praying 
                          for you, and never letting you give-in or give-up. </p>
                        <p>Sometimes our debt is created by our own inability 
                          to change what is keeping us from financial freedom. 
                          Our changes have brought forth a great increase. We 
                          are proud to announce that we have already dropped five 
                          of our outstanding debts and are working on the last 
                          few, before we begin saving for a new home and debt 
                          free future. I started a new full-time job, and we have 
                          begun saving for our future family legacy. Our numbers 
                          have moved from a negative to a positive in just over 
                          two months. We have so much to be thankful for. We eliminated 
                          strongholds by beginning to biblically tithe on our 
                          gross income. We also began giving freewill offerings 
                          and alms. After a year and a half of unemployment, my 
                          wife and I are beginning to see increase, due first 
                          of all to God&#8217;s grace, and also to the 7-week 
                          financial freedom steps, and the fantastic leadership 
                          of our focus group.</p>
                        <p>We wholeheartedly recommend Financial Freedom in 7 
                          Weeks Plus as we wish couples the joy we shared as we 
                          tore down strongholds and began the road to financial 
                          freedom. A million thanks.&#8221;</p>

                          excellent, tool to move individuals from the burden 
                          of debt and poverty into sufficiency and giving! It 
                          not only deals with the practical aspects of budgeting, 
                          planning and assessing personal finances, but it addresses 
                          the wrong actions and motives that brought the problems 
                          in the first place. &quot;Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks 
                          Plus&quot; provides both spiritual training and &quot;hands-on&quot; 
                          detailed financial advice. </p>
                        <p>It is perfect for small group workshops or individuals 
                          and couples seeking to rid themselves of the cycle of 
                          dept and lack. I recommend it and look forward to hearing 
                          of it's impact in the Kingdom.&quot; </p>

                        <p>&quot;I believe a person's life should validate their 
                          teaching. Therefore, I highly recommend Bill and Maureen 
                          Sitter and the &quot;Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus&quot; 
                          book, seminar &amp; small group course. Their life and 
                          ministry is an example of the awesome freedom found 
                          in wisely managing ones finances and bringing them in 
                          line with God's Word. Their teaching makes getting out 
                          of debt a realistic goal.&quot; </p>

                        <p>&quot;Most of us have very little preparation or teaching 
                          regarding making decisions that lead to prosperity rather 
                          than to financial doom. This reality is reflected by 
                          the record amount of consumer debt and the massive number 
                          of personal bankruptcies. You can find help! The Bible 
                          is full of answers that can help you be free to do what 
                          God has called you to do. Bill and Maureen Sitter have 
                          organized many of the scriptures and Biblical concepts 
                          in a step-by-step set of instructions that all of us 
                          can follow to escape the financial rat race and live 
                          a purpose filled life. Their focus group course, &quot;Financial 
                          Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus&quot; also identifies factors 
                          creating financial bondage and shows how to break that 
                          cycle. This course should be a part of the ministry 
                          of every church in America and around the world.&quot;
