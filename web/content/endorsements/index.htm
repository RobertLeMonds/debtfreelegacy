      &quot;I highly recommend &quot;Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus&quot; as a powerful and proven resource to help
      smash the bondage of debt and empower people with abundance and a spirit of generosity. Plain and simple - it works!
      It has worked in our church and it will work in yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill and Maureen Sitter are faithful members of this ministry and people of proven character. They are a precious
      resource to our church, having liberated hundreds of people from crushing debt into generous givers. I urge you to
      get this book and I urge you to contact Bill and Maureen to come to your church - you won't be disappointed.&quot;

      &#8220;Taking the course (or reading the book) Financial Freedom in 7 weeks Plus is like sitting at the feet of Bill
      and Maureen Sitter. We would direct you to Proverbs that would exhort you to heed their words of (financial) wisdom
      which will lead you to the understanding of the Lord&#8217;s principles of prosperity. Their wisdom comes from
      studying the Word and applying it in their life with great success. Their heart for the Lord&#8217;s prosperity,
      along with a heart of giving, has given them a personal goal of giving from their abundance $1,000,000 into the
      Kingdom in their lifetime. Their heart for you who want to sit at their feet is what at you will learn the
      &#8220;ways of the Lord&#8221; and grow abundantly in the Lord&#8217;s prosperity. They believe that those who will
      learn from them will personally prosper so much that they (and you) will give $1,000,000,000 into the advancement of
      the Kingdom of the Lord. There is no better place to learn.&#8221;

      &#8220;I&#8217;ve known Bill and Maureen for over twenty years. They are a rock-solid couple &#8211; pursuing
      excellence in every part of their lives. Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus is a down-to-earth, workable program
      designed to liberate families from financial bondage. With this new freedom, a family can rise above the fray, catch
      a bigger vision for their lives, and begin pursuing the noble cause that God is calling them to. The book breaks the
      bondage then releases a family toward victorious living.&#8221;

      &#8220;As an executive in a large retail company employing thousands of people I have witnessed firsthand the
      devastation caused by uncontrolled debt in the lives of our employees. Being overwhelmed by debt is a major cause of
      marital stress. It also has a significant impact on employee productivity. Miracles happens in marriages and jobs
      when this debt is eliminated for good. Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus has been the generator of these types of
      miracles. I strongly recommend this course.&#8221;

      &quot;It is the plan of God that we would make practical application of biblical truth to affect our lives and the
      world around us. This book provides the tools to do both by our first achieving a debt free lifestyle. It is written
      in a very easy to read, user-friendly format to remove all fears and hindrances to tackling debt. It is highly
      recommended.&quot;

      &#8220;Bill and Maureen have presented their Financial Freedom course on my radio program Christian Investors Daily
      several times and have also presented it to the National Association of Christian Financial Consultants at the
      National Convention in Virginia. I have gotten to know both of them personally and financially. They teach what they
      live. My family knows their family. This is a couple who loves the Lord and lives by what they preach and teach.
      Listen to what they teach, because it is not them speaking, but God speaking through them.&#8221;

      &#8220;Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus is a powerful tool to teach and manage your finances in line with
      God&#8217;s Word. Bill and Maureen Sitter&#8217;s lives demonstrate the truth the Scriptural principles that they
      teach. These principles will change your life. I highly recommend the Sitter&#8217;s Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks

      &#8220;Karen and I have known Bill and Maureen for over 13 years and at our very first meeting with them we saw and
      heard their heart for Debt Free Legacy. We have watched as their vision took shape and became their first edition
      and now their second edition. We are in complete agreement that to advance the Kingdom people must be set debt free
      and to know God&#8217;s Word concerning finances. We have seen people set free from debt bondage through their
      ministry and whole heartedly recommend it to everyone and every church.&#8221;

      &#8220;Bill and Maureen Sitter have prepared a thoughtful, Scriptural, and thoroughly practical book entitled
      Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus. Hundreds of people have already read and applied the principles. Their
      testimonies are the best possible endorsement of this material.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would add this promise: if you examine the main points and prayerfully apply them, your finances will be blessed
      and you will experience freedom from oppression, confusion, and debt. Beyond that, their seven-week focus groups
      offer a hands-on opportunity to move from theory to life-giving experiences. It&#8217;s more than a book and a
      follow-up class. It actually is an invitation to a life of financial freedom.&#8221;

      easier for the congregation to comprehend and practice.&#8221;

      &#8220;My wife Laurie and I would love to personally thank you both for a successful Financial Freedom course. We
      would first like to express our gratitude for your vision of financial freedom from debt bondage that you both have
      taken and shared with so many. Your close relationship with the Father sprang forth a vision that is now multiplying
      in fruition. Thank you for our focus group leaders and leaders in training who taught by example. Seeing them
      already living debt free, allowed us both to see this life was possible. We enjoyed their breakthroughs and their
      determination to see us succeed. It means the world when people are behind you, praying for you, and never letting
      you give-in or give-up.

      Sometimes our debt is created by our own inability to change what is keeping us from financial freedom. Our changes
      have brought forth a great increase. We are proud to announce that we have already dropped five of our outstanding
      debts and are working on the last few, before we begin saving for a new home and debt free future. I started a new
      full-time job, and we have begun saving for our future family legacy. Our numbers have moved from a negative to a
      positive in just over two months. We have so much to be thankful for. We eliminated strongholds by beginning to
      biblically tithe on our gross income. We also began giving freewill offerings and alms. After a year and a half of
      unemployment, my wife and I are beginning to see increase, due first of all to God&#8217;s grace, and also to the
      7-week financial freedom steps, and the fantastic leadership of our focus group.
    </p>
    <p>
      We wholeheartedly recommend Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus as we wish couples the joy we shared as we tore down
      strongholds and began the road to financial freedom. A million thanks.&#8221;

      &quot;Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus&quot; is an excellent, tool to move individuals from the burden of debt and
      poverty into sufficiency and giving! It not only deals with the practical aspects of budgeting, planning and
      assessing personal finances, but it addresses the wrong actions and motives that brought the problems in the first
      place. &quot;Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus&quot; provides both spiritual training and &quot;hands-on&quot;
      detailed financial advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perfect for small group workshops or individuals and couples seeking to rid themselves of the cycle of dept
      and lack. I recommend it and look forward to hearing of it's impact in the Kingdom.&quot;

      &quot;I believe a person's life should validate their teaching. Therefore, I highly recommend Bill and Maureen
      Sitter and the &quot;Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus&quot; book, seminar &amp; small group course. Their life and
      ministry is an example of the awesome freedom found in wisely managing ones finances and bringing them in line with
      God's Word. Their teaching makes getting out of debt a realistic goal.&quot;

      &quot;Most of us have very little preparation or teaching regarding making decisions that lead to prosperity rather
      than to financial doom. This reality is reflected by the record amount of consumer debt and the massive number of
      personal bankruptcies. You can find help! The Bible is full of answers that can help you be free to do what God has
      called you to do. Bill and Maureen Sitter have organized many of the scriptures and Biblical concepts in a
      step-by-step set of instructions that all of us can follow to escape the financial rat race and live a purpose
      filled life. Their focus group course, &quot;Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus&quot; also identifies factors
      creating financial bondage and shows how to break that cycle. This course should be a part of the ministry of every
      church in America and around the world.&quot;

      Testimonies

    <p>
      In his famous book &ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo;, author Charles Dickens gave a very simplistic formula for
      happiness: &ldquo;spend less than you earn&rdquo;.&nbsp; Fortunately, God&rsquo;s Word &ndash; the Bible provides a
      great deal more depth with over 2,000 scriptures relating to financial matters.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful
      if America, and all the world&rsquo;s debtor nations, as well as all families, would follow even this most basic
      advice from Dickens.&nbsp; The United States of America has set a horrible example for financial management .&nbsp;
      For years, this country (which we love) has spent far, far more than the money it received.&nbsp; The result has
      been debt and the printing of more and more US currency, and the astounding expansion of our national debt&hellip;a
      debt that future generations will have to repay.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      It will take many years for wise men and women leaders to return America to a stable financial
      platform&hellip;assuming they have the courage to stay the course.&nbsp; However, the average person or family must
      take a fast track approach.&nbsp; After all, we cannot just print currency (at least not legally) and we cannot
      float bonds or borrow long-term from banks and foreign nations, like China.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, the Bible is loaded with real world advice on how Christians can be good stewards of the resources God
      has blessed us with.&nbsp; As a quick refresher, take a few minutes to read Deuteronomy 8:18, Psalms 50:10 and 1st
      Chronicles 29:11-12.&nbsp; These are just a few of the scriptures attesting to the fact that <u>God owns
      everything</u> and only <u>He gives us the power and ability to get wealth</u>. <a href=
      "http://www.debtfreelegacy.com/">Www.debtfreelegacy.com</a> is a ministry dedicated to helping people achieve their
      God-given destinies.&nbsp; The Legacy Edition workbook &ldquo;Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus&rdquo; helps people
      work through practical exercises, backed by scriptural support, to get their own financial houses in order.&nbsp;
      Part of the course uses Charles Dickens&rsquo; logic of spending less than you earn.&nbsp; However, the training
      goes far beyond that by leading people on a path to true Financial Freedom&hellip;.God&rsquo;s Way!

          Our testimony begins with desperation. On the morning of June 20, I awoke to a checking account balance of one
          penny.&nbsp; Judy and I had never been in such financial straits. We had been faithful tithers since we married in
          1993. We had given regular freewill offerings and alms. We had no credit card obligations. No car payments. We
          also had no money. Zero cash in checking and dwindling scraps in savings.<br>
          <br>
          We were stressed, afraid, full of doubt. <em>God, what is going on?</em><br>
          <br>
          In the early years of our marriage, we led a financial management course at our church in Florida. We gave roughly
          25 percent of our gross income to the church and had plenty left over.&nbsp; In 2001, we moved to San Antonio. I
          had a Good salary, Lots of perks, Regular vacations. Life was good. When Judy began a new career, our income
          soared. As our children grew up and began playing sports, our lives got busier but our marriage remained
          strong.<br>
          <br>
          In March 2009, I lost my job. Days after my last paycheck, I began a new job in marketing. I took a 40 percent cut
          in pay. The economy collapsed. Judy&rsquo;s commissions vanished. We cut expenses and made up the difference with
          my severance package -- but that didn&rsquo;t last long.<br>
          <br>
          After awaking to the one cent checking account, I called a friend from Summit and we fasted. Before the end of the
          day, several hundred dollars appeared in our account. We still needed a breakthrough and enrolled in a Summit
          class, &ldquo;Financial Freedom In 7 Weeks-Plus.&rdquo;&nbsp; After the first class, we came downstairs and
          noticed a scorpion crawling across the carpet. I crushed it with my shoe, scooped it with a napkin and deposited
          it in a trash bin. The Lord reminded me of the scripture, &ldquo;You shall trample scorpions and snakes.&rdquo; I
          knew&nbsp;breakthrough was imminent.<br>
          <br>
          Much of the class seemed like review for us. But the spiritual warfare component opened my eyes. I repented of
          judgments I had made and fasted once a week for financial freedom. On my way to work one morning, Judy said,
          &ldquo;Call me with good news.&rdquo;<br>
          <br>
          I received a freelance assignment that day and phoned Judy. The next morning, she kissed me at the door and said,
          &ldquo;Call me with more good news.&rdquo; &nbsp;The heavens opened. After fasting that morning, a friend I
          hadn&rsquo;t seen in years called and invited me to lunch. Shortly after we met, my friend said, &ldquo;I heard
          you and Judy were struggling.&rdquo; Before I could respond, he handed me a check for $500.<br>
          <br>
          <em>Call me with good news, honey. &hellip;</em><br>
          <br>
          I received a raise. Judy secured a new client. My raise came with a bonus. Judy made a nice commission. My
          mother-in-law decided to buy us a new refrigerator. Judy earned another commission and a bonus! On and on it went:
          new assignments, more clients, good commissions, unexpected gifts. &hellip;<br>
          <br>
          I began to feel like George Bailey at the end of <em>It&rsquo;s A Wonderful Life.</em> Before the course ended, we
          re-financed our house, shaved two years off our mortgage, skipped two months of payments, lowered our monthly
          payments and received substantial cash back from our escrow account.<br>
          <br>
          Our teachers, Tom &amp; Betty Stewart, provided strong leadership. Our classmates inspired us. The Holy Spirit
          worked wonders.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s blessings continue. We have not fully recovered from the financial hit we took
          in 2009. But we are advancing - prayerfully and strategically - and rejoicing in new financial liberties.
        </p><br>
        <span>--- Ken and Judy</span><br>
        <p>
          &#8220;After completing the Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus focus group, our marriage and our lives were forever
          changed. We realized we had allowed certain strongholds to take root in our marriage and family. But our premier
          breakthrough came during the homework from Chapter 1. We made a one-flesh decision to implement the three pronged
          giving plan of tithing, giving above the tithe and the sowing of alms. We had been tithing, for years, but we had
          discovered that unforgiveness had been blocking our financial blessing. When we purposed to give above the tithe,
          and put our written plan into action, God put His plan into action. We are now giving more than we&#8217;ve ever
          given&#8212;and we&#8217;re living Malachi 3:8-10! We are continually being blessed and being groomed to be lean,
          mean, blessing machines! God is no respector of persons, and what He&#8217;s done for us, He can do for you! He
          owns it all and we obediently give a percentage of our combined income to fund His Kingdom glory! We&#8217;ve been
          able to increase that percentage annually.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another huge breakthrough came when we read Chapter 9. We discovered we were being vexed through our kids who had
          exhibited such bad behavioral problems that we had become consumed with their care and with bailing them out of
          trouble by financing their foolishness. Needless to say, we have made changes in this area and we have fully
          embraced the Spiritual Warfare challenge on behalf of our adult children, grandchildren and future generations to
          come!
        </p>
        <p>
          We so appreciate the uncompromising teaching, love, prayer and guidance of Bill and Maureen Sitter &#8211; they
          have laid the groundwork for us to follow. We are debt-free, working at paying off our mortgage and will never be
          in debt-bondage again! Thank you, thank you, thank you, Bill and Maureen for being that example for us, and
          others, to follow!&#8221;

          &#8220;After going through Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus, our lives have not been the same. Unfortunately, we
          were living the statistic where 90% of our discussions were about finances and it affected our marriage
          negatively. Throughout the course our marriage experienced healing. Each week we rediscovered who we were and
          where God wanted us to be in the areas of our relationship and finances. The chapter on breaking curses and
          strongholds helped us become stronger. As our marriage was being restored, so were our finances. Now that we are
          being obedient to the Word and putting into practice what we have learned, we have experienced many breakthroughs
          and blessings. We give God all the glory and we thank Him that He gave Bill and Maureen the vision to help others
          achieve financial victories and become debt free.&#8221;

          I love it! Chapter 9 (Breaking Curses, Blockages &amp; Strongholds) really sets this course apart. Spiritual
          warfare has become a new weapon in my arsenal.<br>
          And this course has helped me measure, understand and control spending.

        <p>
          &#8220;I am so excited because this class has changed my life. I was at a place where I was very dissatisfied with
          the way I was spending my money and could sense it was not the way God wanted me to handle it. I continued to do
          wrong things with my money simply because I knew no other way.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I took the class and began to grab hold of biblical principles, every area of my life began to change. I
          started tithing correctly, giving freewill offerings, and sowing alms. I immediately began to feel better about my
          life. I put a debt repayment plan and a flexible spending plan into action and was able to decrease my debt by 90%
          within the first 6 months. I was able to save more and invest more and, having paid off credit cards, I was able
          to do what my heart&#8217;s desire really was: give more to the church building fund to help leave a legacy for
          the next generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been able to help my friends grasp the principles this course taught me because they can actually see the
          way my life has changed. One friend in particular decided to take the course after talking to me and her personal
          testimony is incredible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thank God for my small group leaders, Dave and Joyce Shoemaker, because they helped me see what God has planned
          for me in His Word. When I apply the principles of His Word, God simply honors that. I now have an inner peace
          that really does surpass all understanding.&#8221;

          &#8220;Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus is a great program that helped us identify and change bad behaviors and
          thinking regarding our finances, and we&#8217;ve seen significant results. This biblically-based course enabled us
          to work together and change those wrong thoughts and habits and focus on being biblically-based stewards.
          Financial planning is not solely Krishna&#8217;s or Bret&#8217;s job &#8211; it&#8217;s a joint (one flesh)
          responsibility for establishing and monitoring our monthly spending habits and goals. It hasn&#8217;t been easy,
          but the tools we&#8217;ve learned to use through this program have given us peace of mind and a greater sense of
          financial security. By following God&#8217;s plan, we&#8217;re definitely believing the promise of Matthew 25:21,
          that as we are faithful in a few things, God will put us in charge of many things. We desire to hear Jesus say,
          &#8220;Well done good and faithful servants.&#8221;

          &#8220;We&#8217;ve been married thirteen years and have had bad spending habits and could not agree on many
          expenditures. Before this 7 week course, we tried budget programs but without success. We began the class and
          immediately began seeing breakthroughs: new career opportunities, bonuses, and even an exceptional car purchase
          deal. We found a new level of agreement in our marriage and began moving towards freedom from debt and a road to
          living financially in a godly manner. The adversary, the devil, fought us all the way but the spiritual warfare
          training (Chapter 9) showed us how to deal with Satan. We now have good goals for the future that include giving
          to God. We see where the money is going. We feel the power of a couple in agreement and we know that all financial
          decisions are really spiritual decisions. Thanks to this book, course, and our focus group leaders, we have the
          tools to build a solid financial and spiritual legacy for our kids.&#8221;

          &#8220;As a direct result of the Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus course, we have a new mindset that will no
          longer allow the past to rob our future. God&#8217;s financial plan is now our priority. We realize that the
          &#8216;stinkin thinkin&#8217; of the world&#8217;s system (easy credit rip offs and debt) is an absolute lie. The
          redeemed of the Lord can and should live like it.&#8221;

          &quot;This 7 week small group program was awesome! Before this course, my husband James and I were never on the
          same page concerning our spending. We now have a true understanding of what it is that God has purposed for us.
          Knowing His Word regarding money, spending, building, saving, and applying the principles of this program will
          help us be in agreement, and stay focused, on how to handle God's money.&quot;

          <em></em>&#8220;Dear Bill and Maureen, When we attended your finance focus group we didn&#8217;t really know what
          to expect. Our finances were in bad shape. Frankly, it was embarrassing to share. Thank you for being so
          compassionate and caring. The small group environment made it easy to be transparent. Thank you for showing us
          God&#8217;s never changing principles. This has definitely helped us gain control of our finances. In addition,
          your course has been very effective in teaching us how to deal with debt. We are on the road to becoming DEBT
          FREE! We know where we stand, and we have a plan, thanks to you. In the name of JESUS we declare, in faith, that
          we are debt free! Thank you and may God bless you both.&#8221;

          &quot;The 7 week course taught us a lot more than just getting our stuff (finances) in order. What we have learned
          empowers us to leave a legacy for our kids and future generations. (It's like opening up a can of worms and seeing
          a cabinet full.) The good news is that the book offers Godly solutions.&quot;

          &#8220;Before the course, my husband Bill and I were not on the same page. I was the one who did everything
          regarding our finances. I tried to give the financial responsibility to my husband, but he didn&#8217;t want it.
          Now, we make financial decisions as a team.&#8221;

          &#8220;For about three years, my wife and I have been discussing/planning for my retirement from my second career.
          The Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus course helped us finalize this plan in an organized manner. We had been
          exposed, at one time or another, to most of the principles, but never in a neat package. The course forced us to
          accurately list all our liabilities and assets. Thus, giving us a true picture of our financial position. It also
          helped us formulate a family spending plan that will allow us to succeed with our plan. At first we were
          overwhelmed, but as we neared the end of the 7-week course all the pieces of the puzzle started to fall into
          place. The greatest impact on us was that our hearts were forever changed towards finances (God&#8217;s money).
          The course made Psalm 37:4 a reality in our lives: &#8216;Delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the
          desires of your heart.&#8217;&#8221;

          &quot;The Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus course was a major blessing to us. We are now applying the principles
          we learned in our daily lives. Before attending the class, Percy managed the finances. Now, we take time to plan
          short and long term financial goals. This course taught us to work together as a one-flesh team regarding our
          finances. As we were participating in the course, we received a great breakthrough. God revealed to us that we
          were sowing good seed into bad ground. We repented and God brought about a great financial blessing, within days.
          Praise God!&quot;

          &#8220;The Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus course gave us the tools to be better stewards of our money. We now
          pay more attention to small financial details. We&#8217;ve learned that it&#8217;s not how much money we make
          that&#8217;s important, but how we manage it. We now know where our money is being spent and how to better plan.
          Instead of ignoring a difficult situation, we face it. The weekly lessons taught us a great deal. We made a slight
          adjustment to our mortgage payment (it cut 5 years off the loan). We now pay it (half of a full monthly payment)
          every two weeks instead of once a month. Also as a result, we will save $20,000 in interest payments. Anyone who
          has self-employment income will definitely be blessed by the Guidelines for the Self Employed in Chapter 2. We
          really appreciate the Sitters&#8217; willingness to teach and train others.&#8221;

          &quot;Most importantly, I learned that Satan really does not want Christians to have this financial freedom
          information. He fights you in whatever area of weakness you have - for me it was &quot;This is too hard!!&quot;
          Prayer and spiritual warfare are both absolutely necessary for true financial success. Thanks to this program, I
          now know how to use both.&quot;

          &#8220;This Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus course showed me that God wants to be a part of my life and my
          finances. Buying this book is a great step financially and spiritually. Any thoughts of fear, stress, shame, and
          not having enough time are clearly thoughts from the devil. The devil wants to keep God out of your financial
          life. The strongest and brightest light is from our Father. So, turn on the light, and let God govern your
          finances. He is ready to bless you and your family! In the 7-week focus group study, you will find faith,
          fellowship, and love. You will also receive an understanding of how to keep God in your bank account and the devil
          out. You will learn practical financial applications based on biblical truths. These truths are essential for the
          rest of your life. The joy that comes from this class will elevate your spirit and strengthen your faith. Tithe to
          your Father, pray for guidance, share with your class, and do your homework. I thank God for His many blessings,
          for this class, and for the incredible focus group leaders called to faithfully teach this life changing
          material.&#8221;

          &#8220;This course provided financial principles that we found are easy to both understand and apply in our daily
          lives. The small focus group (meeting in a friendly home environment) put us at ease. We are both self-employed,
          and we especially benefited from the Guidelines for the Self-Employed (Chapter 2). We learned how to calculate
          &#8220;increase&#8221; and our tithe, even though our income was very irregular.&#8221;

          &#8220;Dave and I have been married for 4 years. Dave is active duty Air Force and we both had quite a bit of debt
          when we got married: student loans, personal loans, car loans, credit cards, etc. We constructed a budget while
          trying to figure out what to do with one income. I searched for a job until we received the news that I was
          pregnant with our first child. We got things under control on our own, but didn&#8217;t feel we were making any
          progress on our debts. They just kept getting bigger, although we were paying the monthly minimums. Then our
          second child came along and the Air Force moved us from NC to TX.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were praying for God to guide us in our finances, wanting desperately to have the financial means to bless our
          church and the ministries that had blessed us, but instead it felt as though we were continuing to drown in debt.
        </p>
        <p>
          We heard about the &#8220;Building A Financial Legacy&#8221; seminar by Bill and Maureen Sitter, and the Finance
          Team. Some of the things we had heard before, but some of it, especially hearing it in the context of Scripture,
          was very eye-opening for us. We desperately wanted to join a small focus group, but the military was sending us to
          Alabama and we would not be in town for the 7-week group. We bought the book and resolved to go ahead and work
          through it on our own.
        </p>
        <p>
          God has richly blessed us for being faithful to Him and applying the principles of the workbook. You can learn
          what God has for you in working through the 7-weeks of material! We had been tithing before the course, but the
          area of giving above the tithe was new to us. Since that time, we have increased our giving, increased the amount
          we are paying on our debts and still have plenty to meet our needs each month. We have tightened our belt on
          non-essentials and wants, and have focused on our savings, debt payment and sowing into God&#8217;s Kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have already paid off two debts and rolled that money over to the next one. We will have all of our credit card
          and personal loans paid off in about one year, and then we&#8217;ll be down to the mortgage, car, and student
          loans.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to encourage everyone who needs guidance or is looking for hope in their finances to get involved in a
          7-week group. We also want to encourage those who for whatever reason cannot commit to the small group to buy the
          book, commit to prayer, do the work, apply the principles, and just see what the Lord can do in your finances!
        </p>
        <p>
          It takes diligence but you can succeed using this workbook even without the blessings of being in a 7-week focus
          group.&#8221;

          The beautiful country of Fiji is made up of several islands and is located to the east of Australia. Through
          Marriage Ministries International, Bill and Maureen forged an incredible friendship with Matai and Mei
          Niumataiwalu. He works at a radio station and she is a homemaker and mother of 3 fine sons. In addition to serving
          as National Married for Life (2=1) Leaders, Matai and Mei started and led a Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus
          focus group. The group was comprised of pastors, a fisherman, a businessman, and their spouses. The results were
          excellent and we are encouraged that more focus groups are planned for the future. The following statements are
          some of the encouraging testimonies from Fiji:
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8220;We have been tremendously blessed because finance was an area we did not often discuss as a family. Sitting
          down and planning financially is a major breakthrough for us. Traditionally, we gave to the extreme extent
          believing that &#8216;tomorrow takes care of itself.&#8217; As a result, our family was occasionally deprived of
          their basic needs. We thank God that we can now pass on to our children, and to future generations, a godly
          financial legacy. As we prepared to teach the &#8216;paradigm shift&#8217; concept, God showed us that a married
          couple must unite as one flesh, and renew their minds with His Word, in order to receive His promises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exodus 20:2 gave us insight into the Lord&#8217;s will for us. Egypt was a house of bondage because Pharaoh had
          enslaved and mistreated God&#8217;s people. We, too, have been brought out of a house of debt bondage through
          Christ and the renewing of our minds. Like the Israelites, we have to enlarge and expand our thinking to be ready
          for God&#8217;s plans to come to pass. We&#8217;re excited at what God is doing. We pray for continuous
          breakthroughs in the Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus project because we believe many families around the world
          will be blessed by it.&#8221;

          another more intensely. After undertaking this course, we are now working together on our daily spending plan,
          which has enabled us to pay off some of our debt. We foresee big financial breakthroughs in our home. The course,

          &#8220;Bula (greetings), we have had the special privilege of serving as leaders in training, to Matai and Mei.
          This was the first time the Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus course was taught in Fiji. The course has been a
          huge blessing to our family. We went into it expecting to be blessed in the area of finance and came out blessed
          in all areas. We realized that in the area of finances, we had excluded God. Once we acknowledged this and allowed
          Him to start ministering to us in this area, it became a spiritual stepping-stone. Through this course we have
          learned to be faithful, not only with finances, but with all the wonderful blessings from Abba Father. It has also
          brought about a spiritual revival in our lives. We thankfully praise God for taking us up to another level. Bill
          and Maureen, we thank God for you and your continuous commitment to give of what He has given you. We pray that as
