                              <p>It  will take many years for wise men and women leaders to return   America to a stable financial  platform&hellip;assuming they have the courage   to stay the course.&nbsp; However, the average person or family must take  a   fast track approach.&nbsp; After all, we  cannot just print currency (at   least not legally) and we cannot float bonds or  borrow long-term from   banks and foreign nations, like China.</p>
                            <p>Fortunately,  the Bible is loaded with real world advice on how   Christians can be good  stewards of the resources God has blessed us   with.&nbsp; As a quick refresher, take a few minutes to  read Deuteronomy   8:18, Psalms 50:10 and 1st Chronicles  29:11-12.&nbsp; These are just a few   of the  scriptures attesting to the fact that <u>God owns everything</u> and only <u>He  gives us the power and ability to get wealth</u>. <a href="http://www.debtfreelegacy.com/">Www.debtfreelegacy.com</a> is a ministry  dedicated to helping people achieve their God-given   destinies.&nbsp; The Legacy Edition workbook &ldquo;Financial Freedom  in 7 Weeks   Plus&rdquo; helps people work through practical exercises, backed by    scriptural support, to get their own financial houses in order.&nbsp; Part of   the course uses Charles Dickens&rsquo;  logic of spending less than you   earn.&nbsp;  However, the training goes far beyond that by leading people on a   path  to true Financial Freedom&hellip;.God&rsquo;s Way!</p></td>

                            <p>Our testimony begins with desperation. On the  morning of June 20, I awoke to a checking account balance of one penny.&nbsp; Judy and I had never been in such financial  straits. We had been faithful tithers since we married in 1993. We had given  regular freewill offerings and alms. We had no credit card obligations. No car  payments. We also had no money. Zero cash in checking and dwindling scraps in  savings.<br>
                              <br>
                              We were stressed, afraid, full of doubt. <em>God, what is going on?</em> <br>
                              <br>
                              In the early years of our marriage, we led a financial management course at our  church in Florida.  We gave roughly 25 percent of our gross income to the church and had plenty  left over.&nbsp; In 2001, we moved to San Antonio. I had a Good  salary, Lots of perks, Regular vacations. Life was good. When Judy began a new  career, our income soared. As our children grew up and began playing sports,  our lives got busier but our marriage remained strong.<br>
                              <br>
                              In March 2009, I lost my job. Days after my last paycheck, I began a new job in  marketing. I took a 40 percent cut in pay. The economy collapsed. Judy&rsquo;s  commissions vanished. We cut expenses and made up the difference with my  severance package -- but that didn&rsquo;t last long.<br>
                              <br>
                              After awaking to the one cent checking account, I called a friend from Summit and we fasted.  Before the end of the day, several hundred dollars appeared in our account. We  still needed a breakthrough and enrolled in a Summit class, &ldquo;Financial Freedom In 7  Weeks-Plus.&rdquo;&nbsp; After the first class, we  came downstairs and noticed a scorpion crawling across the carpet. I crushed it  with my shoe, scooped it with a napkin and deposited it in a trash bin. The  Lord reminded me of the scripture, &ldquo;You shall trample scorpions and snakes.&rdquo; I  knew&nbsp;breakthrough was imminent.<br>
                              <br>
                              Much of the class seemed like review for us. But the spiritual warfare  component opened my eyes. I repented of judgments I had made and fasted once a  week for financial freedom. On my way to work one morning, Judy said, &ldquo;Call me  with good news.&rdquo;<br>
                              <br>
                              I received a freelance assignment that day and phoned Judy. The next morning,  she kissed me at the door and said, &ldquo;Call me with more good news.&rdquo; &nbsp;The heavens opened. After fasting that  morning, a friend I hadn&rsquo;t seen in years called and invited me to lunch. Shortly  after we met, my friend said, &ldquo;I heard you and Judy were struggling.&rdquo; Before I  could respond, he handed me a check for $500.<br>
                              <br>
                              <em>Call me with good news, honey. &hellip;</em><br>
                              <br>
                              I received a raise. Judy secured a new client. My raise came with a bonus. Judy  made a nice commission. My mother-in-law decided to buy us a new refrigerator.  Judy earned another commission and a bonus! On and on it went: new assignments,  more clients, good commissions, unexpected gifts. &hellip;<br>
                              <br>
                              I began to feel like George Bailey at the end of <em>It&rsquo;s A Wonderful Life. </em>Before  the course ended, we re-financed our house, shaved two years off our mortgage,  skipped two months of payments, lowered our monthly payments and received  substantial cash back from our escrow account.<br>

                              Our teachers, Tom &amp; Betty Stewart, provided strong leadership. Our  classmates inspired us. The Holy Spirit worked wonders.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s blessings continue. We have not fully  recovered from the financial hit we took in 2009. But we are advancing -  prayerfully and strategically - and rejoicing in new financial liberties.</p>

                        <p>&#8220;After completing the Financial Freedom in 7 
                          Weeks Plus focus group, our marriage and our lives were 
                          forever changed. We realized we had allowed certain 
                          strongholds to take root in our marriage and family. 
                          But our premier breakthrough came during the homework 
                          from Chapter 1. We made a one-flesh decision to implement 
                          the three pronged giving plan of tithing, giving above 
                          the tithe and the sowing of alms. We had been tithing, 
                          for years, but we had discovered that unforgiveness 
                          had been blocking our financial blessing. When we purposed 
                          to give above the tithe, and put our written plan into 
                          action, God put His plan into action. We are now giving 
                          more than we&#8217;ve ever given&#8212;and we&#8217;re 
                          living Malachi 3:8-10! We are continually being blessed 
                          and being groomed to be lean, mean, blessing machines! 
                          God is no respector of persons, and what He&#8217;s 
                          done for us, He can do for you! He owns it all and we 
                          obediently give a percentage of our combined income 
                          to fund His Kingdom glory! We&#8217;ve been able to 
                          increase that percentage annually.</p>
                        <p>Another huge breakthrough came when we read Chapter 
                          9. We discovered we were being vexed through our kids 
                          who had exhibited such bad behavioral problems that 
                          we had become consumed with their care and with bailing 
                          them out of trouble by financing their foolishness. 
                          Needless to say, we have made changes in this area and 
                          we have fully embraced the Spiritual Warfare challenge 
                          on behalf of our adult children, grandchildren and future 
                          generations to come!</p>
                        <p>We so appreciate the uncompromising teaching, love, 
                          prayer and guidance of Bill and Maureen Sitter &#8211; 
                          they have laid the groundwork for us to follow. We are 
                          debt-free, working at paying off our mortgage and will 
                          never be in debt-bondage again! Thank you, thank you, 
                          thank you, Bill and Maureen for being that example for 
                          us, and others, to follow!&#8221;</p>

                        <p>&#8220;After going through Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks 
                          Plus, our lives have not been the same. Unfortunately, 
                          we were living the statistic where 90% of our discussions 
                          were about finances and it affected our marriage negatively. 
                          Throughout the course our marriage experienced healing. 
                          Each week we rediscovered who we were and where God 
                          wanted us to be in the areas of our relationship and 
                          finances. The chapter on breaking curses and strongholds 
                          helped us become stronger. As our marriage was being 
                          restored, so were our finances. Now that we are being 
                          obedient to the Word and putting into practice what 
                          we have learned, we have experienced many breakthroughs 
                          and blessings. We give God all the glory and we thank 
                          Him that He gave Bill and Maureen the vision to help 
                          others achieve financial victories and become debt free.&#8221;

                          And this course has helped me measure, understand and control spending. </p>

<p>&#8220;I am so excited because this class has changed 
                          my life. I was at a place where I was very dissatisfied 
                          with the way I was spending my money and could sense 
                          it was not the way God wanted me to handle it. I continued 
                          to do wrong things with my money simply because I knew 
                          no other way. </p>
                        <p>When I took the class and began to grab hold of biblical 
                          principles, every area of my life began to change. I 
                          started tithing correctly, giving freewill offerings, 
                          and sowing alms. I immediately began to feel better 
                          about my life. I put a debt repayment plan and a flexible 
                          spending plan into action and was able to decrease my 
                          debt by 90% within the first 6 months. I was able to 
                          save more and invest more and, having paid off credit 
                          cards, I was able to do what my heart&#8217;s desire 
                          really was: give more to the church building fund to 
                          help leave a legacy for the next generation. </p>
                        <p>I have been able to help my friends grasp the principles 
                          this course taught me because they can actually see 
                          the way my life has changed. One friend in particular 
                          decided to take the course after talking to me and her 
                          personal testimony is incredible. </p>
                        <p>I thank God for my small group leaders, Dave and Joyce 
                          Shoemaker, because they helped me see what God has planned 
                          for me in His Word. When I apply the principles of His 
                          Word, God simply honors that. I now have an inner peace 
                          that really does surpass all understanding.&#8221; </p>

                        <p>&#8220;Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus is a great 
                          program that helped us identify and change bad behaviors 
                          and thinking regarding our finances, and we&#8217;ve 
                          seen significant results. This biblically-based course 
                          enabled us to work together and change those wrong thoughts 
                          and habits and focus on being biblically-based stewards. 
                          Financial planning is not solely Krishna&#8217;s or 
                          Bret&#8217;s job &#8211; it&#8217;s a joint (one flesh) 
                          responsibility for establishing and monitoring our monthly 
                          spending habits and goals. It hasn&#8217;t been easy, 
                          but the tools we&#8217;ve learned to use through this 
                          program have given us peace of mind and a greater sense 
                          of financial security. By following God&#8217;s plan, 
                          we&#8217;re definitely believing the promise of Matthew 
                          25:21, that as we are faithful in a few things, God 
                          will put us in charge of many things. We desire to hear 
                          Jesus say, &#8220;Well done good and faithful servants.&#8221;</p>

                        <p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been married thirteen years and 
                          have had bad spending habits and could not agree on 
                          many expenditures. Before this 7 week course, we tried 
                          budget programs but without success. We began the class 
                          and immediately began seeing breakthroughs: new career 
                          opportunities, bonuses, and even an exceptional car 
                          purchase deal. We found a new level of agreement in 
                          our marriage and began moving towards freedom from debt 
                          and a road to living financially in a godly manner. 
                          The adversary, the devil, fought us all the way but 
                          the spiritual warfare training (Chapter 9) showed us 
                          how to deal with Satan. We now have good goals for the 
                          future that include giving to God. We see where the 
                          money is going. We feel the power of a couple in agreement 
                          and we know that all financial decisions are really 
                          spiritual decisions. Thanks to this book, course, and 
                          our focus group leaders, we have the tools to build 
                          a solid financial and spiritual legacy for our kids.&#8221;

                          financial plan is now our priority. We realize that

                          for us. Knowing His Word regarding money, spending, 
                          building, saving, and applying the principles of this

                        <p><em></em>&#8220;Dear Bill and Maureen, When we attended 
                          your finance focus group we didn&#8217;t really know 
                          what to expect. Our finances were in bad shape. Frankly, 
                          it was embarrassing to share. Thank you for being so 
                          compassionate and caring. The small group environment 
                          made it easy to be transparent. Thank you for showing 
                          us God&#8217;s never changing principles. This has definitely 
                          helped us gain control of our finances. In addition, 
                          your course has been very effective in teaching us how 
                          to deal with debt. We are on the road to becoming DEBT 
                          FREE! We know where we stand, and we have a plan, thanks 
                          to you. In the name of JESUS we declare, in faith, that 
                          we are debt free! Thank you and may God bless you both.&#8221;</p>

                          getting our stuff (finances) in order. What we have 
                          learned empowers us to leave a legacy for our kids and 
                          future generations. (It's like opening up a can of worms 
                          and seeing a cabinet full.) The good news is that the 
                          book offers Godly solutions.&quot;</p>

                          not on the same page. I was the one who did everything 
                          regarding our finances. I tried to give the financial 
                          responsibility to my husband, but he didn&#8217;t want 
                          it. Now, we make financial decisions as a team.&#8221;</p>

                        <p>&#8220;For about three years, my wife and I have been 
                          discussing/planning for my retirement from my second 
                          career. The Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus course 
                          helped us finalize this plan in an organized manner. 
                          We had been exposed, at one time or another, to most 
                          of the principles, but never in a neat package. The 
                          course forced us to accurately list all our liabilities 
                          and assets. Thus, giving us a true picture of our financial 
                          position. It also helped us formulate a family spending 
                          plan that will allow us to succeed with our plan. At 
                          first we were overwhelmed, but as we neared the end 
                          of the 7-week course all the pieces of the puzzle started 
                          to fall into place. The greatest impact on us was that 
                          our hearts were forever changed towards finances (God&#8217;s 
                          money). The course made Psalm 37:4 a reality in our 
                          lives: &#8216;Delight yourself in the Lord and He will 
                          give you the desires of your heart.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

                          was a major blessing to us. We are now applying the 
                          principles we learned in our daily lives. Before attending 
                          the class, Percy managed the finances. Now, we take 
                          time to plan short and long term financial goals. This 
                          course taught us to work together as a one-flesh team 
                          regarding our finances. As we were participating in 
                          the course, we received a great breakthrough. God revealed 
                          to us that we were sowing good seed into bad ground. 
                          We repented and God brought about a great financial 
                          blessing, within days. Praise God!&quot;</p>

                          gave us the tools to be better stewards of our money. 
                          We now pay more attention to small financial details. 
                          We&#8217;ve learned that it&#8217;s not how much money 
                          we make that&#8217;s important, but how we manage it. 
                          We now know where our money is being spent and how to 
                          better plan. Instead of ignoring a difficult situation, 
                          we face it. The weekly lessons taught us a great deal. 
                          We made a slight adjustment to our mortgage payment 
                          (it cut 5 years off the loan). We now pay it (half of 
                          a full monthly payment) every two weeks instead of once 
                          a month. Also as a result, we will save $20,000 in interest 
                          payments. Anyone who has self-employment income will 
                          definitely be blessed by the Guidelines for the Self 
                          Employed in Chapter 2. We really appreciate the Sitters&#8217; 
                          willingness to teach and train others.&#8221;</p>

                        <p>&quot;Most importantly, I learned that Satan really 
                          does not want Christians to have this financial freedom 
                          information. He fights you in whatever area of weakness 
                          you have - for me it was &quot;This is too hard!!&quot; 
                          Prayer and spiritual warfare are both absolutely necessary 
                          for true financial success. Thanks to this program, 
                          I now know how to use both.&quot; </p>

                          showed me that God wants to be a part of my life and 
                          my finances. Buying this book is a great step financially 
                          and spiritually. Any thoughts of fear, stress, shame, 
                          and not having enough time are clearly thoughts from 
                          the devil. The devil wants to keep God out of your financial 
                          life. The strongest and brightest light is from our 
                          Father. So, turn on the light, and let God govern your 
                          finances. He is ready to bless you and your family! 
                          In the 7-week focus group study, you will find faith, 
                          fellowship, and love. You will also receive an understanding 
                          of how to keep God in your bank account and the devil 
                          out. You will learn practical financial applications 
                          based on biblical truths. These truths are essential 
                          for the rest of your life. The joy that comes from this 
                          class will elevate your spirit and strengthen your faith. 
                          Tithe to your Father, pray for guidance, share with 
                          your class, and do your homework. I thank God for His 
                          many blessings, for this class, and for the incredible 
                          focus group leaders called to faithfully teach this 
                          life changing material.&#8221; </p>

                          and we especially benefited from the Guidelines for 
                          the Self-Employed (Chapter 2). We learned how to calculate

                        <p>&#8220;Dave and I have been married for 4 years. Dave 
                          is active duty Air Force and we both had quite a bit 
                          of debt when we got married: student loans, personal 
                          loans, car loans, credit cards, etc. We constructed 
                          a budget while trying to figure out what to do with 
                          one income. I searched for a job until we received the 
                          news that I was pregnant with our first child. We got 
                          things under control on our own, but didn&#8217;t feel 
                          we were making any progress on our debts. They just 
                          kept getting bigger, although we were paying the monthly 
                          minimums. Then our second child came along and the Air 
                          Force moved us from NC to TX. </p>
                        <p>We were praying for God to guide us in our finances, 
                          wanting desperately to have the financial means to bless 
                          our church and the ministries that had blessed us, but 
                          instead it felt as though we were continuing to drown 
                          in debt. </p>
                        <p>We heard about the &#8220;Building A Financial Legacy&#8221; 
                          seminar by Bill and Maureen Sitter, and the Finance 
                          Team. Some of the things we had heard before, but some 
                          of it, especially hearing it in the context of Scripture, 
                          was very eye-opening for us. We desperately wanted to 
                          join a small focus group, but the military was sending 
                          us to Alabama and we would not be in town for the 7-week 
                          group. We bought the book and resolved to go ahead and 
                          work through it on our own. </p>
                        <p>God has richly blessed us for being faithful to Him 
                          and applying the principles of the workbook. You can 
                          learn what God has for you in working through the 7-weeks 
                          of material! We had been tithing before the course, 
                          but the area of giving above the tithe was new to us. 
                          Since that time, we have increased our giving, increased 
                          the amount we are paying on our debts and still have 
                          plenty to meet our needs each month. We have tightened 
                          our belt on non-essentials and wants, and have focused 
                          on our savings, debt payment and sowing into God&#8217;s 
                          Kingdom. </p>
                        <p>We have already paid off two debts and rolled that 
                          money over to the next one. We will have all of our 
                          credit card and personal loans paid off in about one 
                          year, and then we&#8217;ll be down to the mortgage, 
                          car, and student loans.</p>
                        <p>We want to encourage everyone who needs guidance or 
                          is looking for hope in their finances to get involved 
                          in a 7-week group. We also want to encourage those who 
                          for whatever reason cannot commit to the small group 
                          to buy the book, commit to prayer, do the work, apply 
                          the principles, and just see what the Lord can do in 
                          your finances!</p>
                        <p>It takes diligence but you can succeed using this workbook 
                          even without the blessings of being in a 7-week focus 
                          group.&#8221;</p>

                          Plus course, the Lord gave us a new understanding of 
                          how to steward our finances. The course also gave us

                          has brought me freedom from bondage. For years I struggled 
                          with expenses. I learned through this course that I 
                          cannot do it without asking and including God in my 
                          finances. He has blessed me in many ways through this 
                          program. My business has prospered with increased customers 
                          and revenues and I have learned (most importantly) to 
                          lean on Him for decisions and strength and faith. I 
                          left credit card bondage behind and am soaring on eagles

                          me how to: handle my finances, to plan and to live my 
                          dreams and goals.&quot;</p>

                          more focus groups are planned for the future. The following 
                          statements are some of the encouraging testimonies from 
                          Fiji:</p>
                        <p>&#8220;We have been tremendously blessed because finance 
                          was an area we did not often discuss as a family. Sitting 
                          down and planning financially is a major breakthrough 
                          for us. Traditionally, we gave to the extreme extent 
                          believing that &#8216;tomorrow takes care of itself.&#8217; 
                          As a result, our family was occasionally deprived of 
                          their basic needs. We thank God that we can now pass 
                          on to our children, and to future generations, a godly 
                          financial legacy. As we prepared to teach the &#8216;paradigm 
                          shift&#8217; concept, God showed us that a married couple 
                          must unite as one flesh, and renew their minds with 
                          His Word, in order to receive His promises.</p>
                        <p>Exodus 20:2 gave us insight into the Lord&#8217;s will 
                          for us. Egypt was a house of bondage because Pharaoh 
                          had enslaved and mistreated God&#8217;s people. We, 
                          too, have been brought out of a house of debt bondage 
                          through Christ and the renewing of our minds. Like the 
                          Israelites, we have to enlarge and expand our thinking 
                          to be ready for God&#8217;s plans to come to pass. We&#8217;re 
                          excited at what God is doing. We pray for continuous 
                          breakthroughs in the Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus 
                          project because we believe many families around the 
                          world will be blessed by it.&#8221;</p>

                        <p>&#8220;We own a small fishing business. The 7-week 
                          focus group, led by Matai and Mei, taught us a great 
                          deal by using God&#8217;s Word as the standard. We now 
                          communicate better, pray better, pray together, and 
                          love one another more intensely. After undertaking this 
                          course, we are now working together on our daily spending 
                          plan, which has enabled us to pay off some of our debt. 
                          We foresee big financial breakthroughs in our home. 
                          The course, as a whole, has helped us to become much 
                          better stewards at home and in church.&#8221;</p>

                        <p>&#8220;Bula (greetings), we have had the special privilege 
                          of serving as leaders in training, to Matai and Mei. 
                          This was the first time the Financial Freedom in 7 Weeks 
                          Plus course was taught in Fiji. The course has been 
                          a huge blessing to our family. We went into it expecting 
                          to be blessed in the area of finance and came out blessed 
                          in all areas. We realized that in the area of finances, 
                          we had excluded God. Once we acknowledged this and allowed 
                          Him to start ministering to us in this area, it became 
                          a spiritual stepping-stone. Through this course we have 
                          learned to be faithful, not only with finances, but 
                          with all the wonderful blessings from Abba Father. It 
                          has also brought about a spiritual revival in our lives. 
                          We thankfully praise God for taking us up to another 
                          level. Bill and Maureen, we thank God for you and your 
                          continuous commitment to give of what He has given you. 
                          We pray that as you continue to sow into the lives of 
                          others, our Heavenly Father will bless you abundantly.&#8221;
