                          New Small Group Leaders and for singles and married 
                          couples who are already active leaders of 7 week &#8220;Financial 
                          Freedom in 7 Weeks Plus&#8221; groups. All leaders in 
                          this ministry are huge &#8220;impact players&#8221; 
                          who help change lives and empower people to achieve 
                          true financial freedom&#8230;to have all the resources 
                          needed to achieve the plans and the destiny, God has 
                          for them and for each of us. <span>This 
                          ministry is a teaching ministry</span> which uses the 
                          workbook as a teaching guide for the presentation of 
                          7 weeks of progressive information. There certainly 
                          is no requirement for college education or for any special 
                          finance training. <span>We do not attempt 
                          to be financial counselors, and most of our dedicated 
                          leaders are currently working their own way to achieving 
                          financial freedom, using God&#8217;s Word and this workbook 
                          as the tools.</span> If you have a heart to change lives, 
                          especially in the area of freedom from debt bondage, 
                          then you have come to the right place. If this website
